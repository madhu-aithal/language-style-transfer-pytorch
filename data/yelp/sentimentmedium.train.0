i was sadly mistaken .
so on to the hoagies , the italian is general run of the mill .
minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce .
nothing really special & not worthy of the $ _num_ price tag .
second , the steak hoagie , it is atrocious .
i had to pay $ _num_ to add cheese to the hoagie .
she told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side .
are you kidding me ?
i was not going to pay for the dressing on the side .
i ordered it without lettuce , tomato , onions , or dressing .
are you kidding me ?
i paid $ _num_ to add sauted mushrooms , onions , and cheese .
in this case , never .
( the hoagie bun was better than average . )
wake up or you are going to lose your business .
this place has none of them .
it is april and there are no grass tees yet .
there is no grass on the range .
bottom line , this place sucks .
someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be .
very disappointed in the customer service .
we will not be back .
the iced tea is also terrible tasting .
used to go there for tires , brakes , etc .
plus , _num_ of the new tires went flat within _num_ weeks .
terrible .
i was originally told it would take _num_ mins .
slow , over priced , i 'll go elsewhere next time .
so frustrated .
never going back .
they seem overpriced , too .
do n't waste your time .
not a call , not the estimate , nothing .
shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like .
she was very uncomfortable .
at this point they were open and would be for another hour .
wait _num_ hrs .
she has to wait _num_ days to be seen .
absolutely the worst care in all my experience with vets !
this place went from great to horrible .
absolutely no problems .
noisy snow tires in the summer !
i told him they are too noisy .
very rude and once they get paid have no ethics .
i dropped off _num_ shirts at this establishment just before thanksgiving .
they have offered $ _num_ a shirt for the shirts they lost .
i would n't use their services again if you paid me to .
sign is blank and all fixtures from the store have been removed .
bread or not , it still was n't great .
it was a basic salad , no big deal .
i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be .
nah ... why bother when there are so many other options around .
just do n't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds .
but apparently , mama has left the kitchen .
as for my mushroom and cheese omelette , the cheese was lacking .
if i wanted a microwave omelet i would have gone to burger king .
two scrambled whole eggs , italian toast , and home fries .
in a considerably nasty tone .
trash .
guess who was n't too busy , carnegie coffee company down the street .
nothing special .
it was hot in there and i do n't think they have ac .
it does n't say cash only anywhere inside or on the menu either .
there is an atm , but it has a $ _num_ charge to use .
ca n't believe a place in _num_ does n't take cards .
the coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate .
i fed my whole family breakfast ( _num_ of us ) for $ _num_ .
not to mention my allergies were in full effect .
the bathroom was so inconvenient to get in and out of .
breakfast was pathetic .
i 'll be sure to spend my money elsewhere next time .
if i could give this place less than one star , i would .
apparently , we were out of luck .
it 's a tiny long bar just like the old irish pubs .
no more smoking allowed .
same lousy service .
i really really want this place to do better .
we need more irish pubs and local old time watering holes .
whatever the case , they have cold guinness .
some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .
we used a coupon from the paper for a _num_ topping _num_ cut sicilian .
the onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can .
it was gross .
the veggies were old and wilted , and there was no dressing on either .
no flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam .
i have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed .
what a mistake .
the business is not run the way it has been in the past .
this is probably the worst business in carnegie .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
the inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for .
it smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door .
the fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft .
the corn lacked butter .
service was n't too bad - nice people .
unfortunately , there are only two reviews .
they did not acknowledge me .
the door i was at had signage ( open hours ) .
take it from me ; avoid this place at all cost .
does n't even taste good as american style chinese food .
i used to order takeout here once every month or so .
let alone one that the food is n't even that good .
also the inside is dirty as heck .
needless to say , we never returned .
otherwise i 'll have to have him put to sleep .
do n't take your cat here .
do n't waste your time or money at this denny 's .
i never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members .
i did n't feel welcome here .
but it 's not well maintained .
terrible service .
but my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit .
but it was n't just the knowledge of the menu .
there was no one filling up water .
my biggest complaint , however , is what happened with our meals .
so , he took the meals back to the kitchen .
they did n't remake anything .
quite frankly , the fish was n't good at all .
the guy never really even apologized for the mistake .
coming here you get the feeling they have n't changed much .
does that make you a little worried ?
ambiance , like i said , left much to be desired .
consider where this place is , the prices are really really high .
nothing is served on the side with main dishes ... .
papa j 's is expensive and inconsistent .
there are better restaurants in carnegie .
it was so disgusting i could n't eat it .
ugh .
not a ton of flavor there either .
his broccoli was rock hard - like wood !
and the chicken was very dry .
i have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times .
i wo n't go back .
the first time we were there almost _num_ hours .
ridiculous .
if it were up to me i would have never returned .
unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight .
my food was cold and bland , my kids food was cold .
bad food , slow service and rude managers .
papa j 's is no longer the only game in town .
obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management .
appalling !
my husband & i ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time .
my lettuce was drowning in the vinegar .
my husband 's pasta had even less flavor than mine .
we ate about a quarter of the food & could n't even finish it .
and i hate wasting food !
do n't waste your time eating here .
there are much better italian restaurants in pittsburgh .
well , papa j 's has officially priced itself out of our budget .
$ _num_ per salad ?
it 's lettuce , cheese , and pine nuts !
$ _num_ / salad ?
our pizza was cold and our drinks where empty .
we are not going back .
it rather looks like a deli counter .
a bit confusing layout , but tastefully done .
the dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant .
there was no salad or pasta side offered .
this alone i would have given _num_ stars .
annoying ?
confused ?
he appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time .
however , i think i would try somewhere else to dine .
why the hell was there a wait ?
the older man that took us to the table could have done nicer .
the food was not bad but it was not good .
the chicken piccata was flavorful , but not as expected .
it had no signs of being coated and sauted to a rich golden brown .
no pasta was served with the chicken .
the side of vegetables were well cooked , buy again lacked any real flavor .
the total was $ _num_ and change .
my friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage .
the waitress was extremely rude .
too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude !
that is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst .
we sat for _num_ minutes before a server came to our table .
at that point , she said i 'll grab you water and bread .
however , we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold .
we also ordered the `` incredible white pizza '' which was incredibly cold .
while patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible .
also , i wrote to the restaurant and received no response .
for $ _num_ a person it was terrible .
i got the shrimp and veal and my veal was dry .
i ordered a drink _num_ times and never got it .
i 'll probably never go back again .
worst service of all time .
place is a total joke .
the last visit i overlooked the $ _num_ gnocchi special .
okay , shame on us for not asking .
potatoes or pasta are always included with marsala .
never ever again will we return here .
not us .
just so rude .
the worst dental experience of my life .
i have never been so uncomfortable in my life .
save yourself a lot of time , money and pain .
no one should have to go thru what i am currently going thru .
the worst dental office i ever been .
you should avoid it at any time .
would not have my dogs teeth cleaned here !
this place is one of the worst dental offices i 've ever walked into .
i 've never posted a yelp review before .
no sign of italian meat to be found .
no marinara sauce .
you may want to consider having the pizza delivered .
my expectations for mcdonalds are t rarely high .
the cashier took my friends 's order , then promptly ignored me .
the manager was rude when giving me my order .
i 've eaten at various mcdonalds restaurants for over _num_ years .
this mcdonald 's is so bad it 's amazing .
order : big mac , large fries , diet coke .
the soda machine was broken .
no sodas .
left with : big mac , medium fries , no coke .
there 's nothing to see here .
poor customer service .
worst mcdonalds i have ever been to .
last time i went chicken nuggets were under cooked .
people were getting refunds wait time was so long .
soda is watered down and gross .
rude staff doesnt know what they are doing .
just skip this one and you will be better off .
seating inside is very limited .
i 'm not a huge fan of this location .
and there 's hardly any tables to sit at .
this has never happened before and it took me off guard .
the barista came off dishonest and unfriendly with the up sell push .
i will avoid this one at the waterfront for awhile .
with all of the other options in the area , take your money elsewhere !
finally , i find one after _num_ minutes of wondering around .
this is not the first time i 've been hard up to find help .
the store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere .
however , if you 're looking for something specific , good luck .
i usually only stop there if i 'm already at tend waterfront .
not at this location .
this is the absolute worst steak n shake i 've ever been to .
the bf and i got lost around pittsburgh for _num_ min .
wish i had looked it up earlier .
the only thing worse than the food is the service .
there were several things that got me annoyed , one after another .
but the food came cold .
we were so hungry by that point , we just ate whatever we could .
neither angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even once .
might have been a stomach bug but it is kind of strange .
terrible wait staff could n't even seat us .
def not worth the wait .
i really like the chili .
burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad .
pretty hard to mess up a side salad .
as others have said you never know what kind of service you will get .
store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair .
cheap and crap service .
unfortunately the service is very hit or miss .
the service is awful .
the service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service .
i sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared .
it was all i could taste .
tonight they told me that the drive thru was closed .
i have never , ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom .
this one , however , leaves a lot to be desired .
most of the time , they 're downright rude .
dirty and slow .
this location is terrible .
the drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food .
she then told me it only comes with cheese .
so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger .
the meat is badly burned and cold .
it was clear to me this burger was not fresh .
the service is the worst i 've ever seen .
i do n't know how corporate keeps this place open .
i 've complained numerous times but it never does any good .
take the extra _num_ minutes to drive to the south hills location .
food is cheap but portions are small .
also the restaurant is not really clean either .
this restaurant is not my number _num_ choice .
i really do n't know how this place stays open .
on our last visit it took us _num_ minutes to get our waitresses attention .
it took _num_ minutes to get the mustard and mayo .
just bad service .
our waitress was very polite , though .
i have eaten here before and never had any problems .
they completely ignored us so we got up and left .
one table near us had to flag a waitress just to get her attention .
slow service .
food is very cheap though .
i would go here if the service was faster and better .
slow .
still no food .
we were a party of _num_ adults and _num_ kid .
i 've worked at steak n shake before .
it less than _num_ minutes to cook both the burgers and fries .
the manager here needs better training .
i waited _num_ minutes for charred hamburger .
however they ( waitresses ) were nice and apologetic .
could n't believe the waitress thought it was okay to serve .
waitress was rude to them and the manager never came to address the issue .
terrible customer service .
five guy burgers much better .
this is the worst place i 've maybe ever been to .
the outside was filthy with trash all over .
the inside was maybe worse , trash and dirty .
the employees were awful , rude , slow and not caring about a thing .
i ca n't even guess how unsanitary it might be .
disgusting .
i keep forgetting how not good this location is .
i only returned because i was getting my dog groomed at the nearby petco .
actually there was nothing basement like about it .
what will be done with the empty space that is the question ?
$ _num_ for a red bull and vodka ?
in my opinion , sing sing is really not worth it .
lame .
lame as heck .
the music the guys played was all stuff from like _num_ .
i would not recommend anybody go .
this place has gone significantly down hill .
however , each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller .
very slow and boring .
save your $ _num_ and skip this place .
we had reservations , which was good because it was packed that saturday night .
why should it , those computers are always making mistakes .
what was originally an average lowe 's has turned into lowe 's hell .
we would be paying several hundred dollars to get the doors installed .
after the installation , lowe 's would refund us the $ _num_ .
i told him we would like our $ _num_ back .
i can not believe how unprofessional this store was !
goodbye lowes ... hello home depot !
what a shame !
so much rudeness -- checking out and trying to find other items .
clearly there are zero expectations for customer service here .
our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that .
the potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing .
if you are going to order something , i would go with the pizza .
we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good , also .
she sent it back .
no quick and easy app or beers on the house .
to boot , the beer was pretty expensive .
the biggest downfall of duke 's , though , is the food .
the first was flavorless and cold .
the second was passable , but nothing special .
and the last were absolutely awful .
i ate two of the _num_ tenders ( seven ! )
_num_ strikes .
i gave up and refused the offer for another .
i felt bad just ordering free beer so i ordered a sandwich .
bar staff not so much this visit .
we were ignored until i grabbed a table in the back .
neither of us were n't very happy about this .
menus for drinks and food have no prices .
$ _num_ for a banana split cocktail ?
waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts .
trying to get something healthy , i ordered the apple pecan salad .
i could barely eat the salad .
perhaps next time we 'll just stop by for drinks instead .
i guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene .
the food was absolutely gross !
first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread ( lame ) !
gross !
mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location .
the food is crap .
this time , it was ridiculous .
on top of that , the customer service sucked .
for $ _num_ , it was n't worth it .
mediocre service .
cold food !
our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted .
bland food .
_num_ beer per hour maximum .
avoid at all costs .
here 's where it gets bad .
_num_ mins later we get our refills .
mind you , our food still has n't came yet .
i was frustrated .
finally , _num_ mins later ... that 's one hour , folks .
yep , the food was cold .
the only compensation we got were $ _num_ game cards .
waitress never apologized .
after spending over $ _num_ plus games , we will never go back .
it was a saturday !
_num_ bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full .
all i have to say is get your crap together .
for how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends .
apathetic service staff all around , the peanut and i were really disappointed .
wo n't be back .
let me tell you about my bad experience first .
what the hell !
i was just really turned off from that experience .
lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people !
i will not be back again to eat .
the outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste .
the fish itself was bland .
i was thinking he would have stopped but did n't oh well .
sometime you just get one that is n't .
this place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms .
when our food came though , everything was below average .
did n't see a manager until after 10:30 pm .
needless to say , we did n't stay to eat and went elsewhere .
it 's the customers fault your staff ca n't handle a sat night rush .
i will never spend money here again !
awful awful .
took _num_ minutes to even be acknowledged .
wrong !
first off , service was horrible .
it took about _num_ minutes , minimum , to get our first drinks .
my boyfriend had their philly cheesesteak and he could n't finish it .
was so salty and just not good .
for the price of everything , it was not worth it all .
you 'll save $ $ , time , and frustration !
everything was pretty picked over , which kinda sucked .
so we again go off in search of someone to help .
it also was n't the cleanest place i 've ever seen .
and not well maintained or managed at all .
over priced , over hyped but a hell of a time regardless .
i ate here for lunch today with my wife and _num_ kids .
server was prompt getting to the table , took our order and then disappeared .
grilled cheese , salad and a quesadilla should n't take that long .
mens room did n't have any paper towels to dry hands with .
huge fail for this type of venue .
service is n't too bad , but could be better .
i also thing d & b is n't the cleanest place either .
the bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion .
does n't seem like they keep up with it .
to me , thats a big factor in rating restaurants .
this was n't the cleanest place .
dirty paper towels all over the women 's bathroom .
also they are n't following corporate policy .
very disappointed in his attitude more then anything .
the food here is awful .
i only gave it _num_ stars because i liked my mac and cheese .
everyone else at the table hated their food .
all i have to say is no thanks .
i 'd hate to be there when they are `` busy '' .
worst service i 've ever had !
we left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food .
no apologies nothing .
while sitting there we noticed _num_ other parties walked out as well .
they did n't even get their drinks .
i would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat .
the food was bad .
the bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky .
the waitress was nice but overall i would n't dine here again .
if you are under _num_ you must be accompanied by a _num_ year old .
awful place with rude people .
this place has really gone down hill in the past 3-4 years .
we will not be going back !
if you are here to eat , maybe try somewhere else .
even managers saw us sitting there and didnt bother to greet us .
we will still go here just not try to eat .
i am _num_ and my sisters are younger than i am .
which i was , and i was not allowed in .
avoid eating or drinking anything here .
the service was terrible .
especially multiple employees , hostesses , waitresses , and bus boys .
either way , on a saturday night , i would n't recommend going here .
nina the manager and ashley the cashier extremely rude .
highly recommend that no one ever goes here .
our service was awful as well .
i do n't think i have one good thing to say about this place .
she brought a pile of beverage napkins .
but that 's not the worst .
despite pointing out the problem , she never did do anything about that .
anyway , do n't try to eat here .
just come and play the games , but skip the food .
i wish there were no kids .
she was definitely old enough to understand why she was wrong .
how ridiculous for an arcade game company to turn away kids .
if they had a negative star would have selected the worst rating .
_num_ hour wait and then cold food served .
did not have enough staff in kitchen and never bothered to provide updates .
nothing positive to say other than do n't go there .
ghetto , the server kept calling me baby all night .
staff is rude .
waited _num_ minutes for our drinks and an additional _num_ minutes for our food .
i could understand if they were busy , but it was n't at all .
the food was n't very good at all .
i 've never sent back food , ever , but this was ridiculous .
the server takes my plate , and says they would make it right .
ca n't say much for an office that is managed this way .
the lack of empathy was even more disturbing .
do n't take it out on the person they are incorrectly calling .
the frosty is never frosty always runny .
`` nah '' it was _num_ .
guess not .
cant rate the food cause i have n't received any .
but since its _num_ guess they are closed .
if there was a way to give no stars i would .
horrible service .
so we called back and asked for our money back .
if you want terrible pizza go here .
not worth one star !
- original pretzel appetizer .
the half order of ribs looked like a full rack .
- lots of food choices ... burgers ... steak ... chicken ... salads .
lots of drink choices ... beers ... wines ... mixed drinks .
- none of the food was super awesome .
nothing was awful , but nothing stood out in any way .
- kind of dead on a monday night with 3/4 of the place empty .
head next door to sing sing for drinks , though .
the low point lately has been the food .
unfortunately rock bottom is one that falls into that category .
it 's pretty much a crap shoot .
unfortunately , it seems there is zero attention to food quality .
till then , it 's hit or miss !
i must admit , i do like the brews .
i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes .
other than that , meh .
the food is pretty forgettable .
not worth $ _num_ unfortunately the sausage platter was $ _num_ .
the restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table .
i have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable .
their food is pretty much like their beers , forgettable .
here 's where i ran into problems .
it was very greasy and had virtually no crab .
the service was ok , not the best not the worst .
if i was n't so hungry i would n't have eaten them at all !
the husband had the bbq chicken pizza .
it blew my crappy tacos out of the water !
and the underwhelming food sealed the deal .
poor service and food .
i waited _num_ minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence .
so i had to wait an additional _num_ minutes to find someone to pay .
on to the important part ... food was terrible .
i had a burger and it was pathetic .
otherwise , you are better off skipping it .
unfortunately the reality did n't match the idea of the burger .
it was like having a standard old boring burger .
i was very disappointed .
for $ _num_ , i would have expected a lot more flavor .
but yes , you guessed it , that 's overpriced too .
the food was uninspired , tired , and ordinary .
spicy and thick it went down easy enough .
the steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of ... .
not the best dinner they have eaten .
it was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon .
over all this meal was a wash .
corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck .
the service has also suffered tremendously .
i do n't expect this rock bottom to be around too much longer .
i could not even finish half of mine .
if i were to go back , it certainly would not be to eat .
meh is the only thing i leave here feeling .
i ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me .
it was topped with an olive and a mini pickle ... odd .
my `` squash '' side was lacking squash .
instead all squash was replaced by peppers ... which i can not eat .
very disappointing menu .
i 'm very disappointed to say this place has gone down hill .
every time we are seated in the dining area it 's a bad experience .
i tried to steal a few of his fries , which were a failure .
on my own dish i had the classic mac n ' chicken .
and when i say smothered here , this is not a good thing .
everything else , avoid .
first bad experience at this place .
double swiss burger was as tasteless as they could make .
i asked for medium cooked and they gave me burnt .
instead of caramelized onions , they added raw onions .
the waiter did not even bother to ask if everything was okay .
wo n't visit again .
overall , it was a mediocre experience with forgettable food .
i wo n't be going back .
my boyfriend 's bison burger was not that tasty either he sent it back .
very disappointed with this place .
do not come here to eat .
_num_ stars because the beer was good .
no salsa , no lettuce , guac , sour cream .
it was so underwhelming .
i wish the food could match the quality of their beer .
if you want rock bottom food , head to rock bottom .
slow service , horrible , horrible food .
was served freezing cold enchiladas and pizza .
terrible customer service , disrespectful in fact .
never going back again and i would advise against master muffler to all others .
second , the sodas are not free refills !
but the biggest problem is the food and drink .
_num_ - a lot of the drinks did n't have prices on them .
it 's not that hard .
_num_ - put the drink prices on the website too .
not all the prices are on the website , which makes for difficult planning .
the food , however , is mediocre at best .
i could not see a thing .
it was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl .
it looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked .
it was n't edible .
it does n't even have to be memorable ... just not offensive .
but damn , i was hungry !
i feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole .
i 'd give the comedians _num_ stars , and the food zero stars .
no , i do n't want you to take our food back !
is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on ?
sadly , no .
the service did n't get any better .
the food was lousy .
one of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich .
but hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable .
we also sent an order of chicken fingers back ... dryer than sand .
overpriced , shitty food and drinks .
hell , tgi friday 's would have been better .
they did n't let people in because they claimed the room was not ready .
seating is first come , first served .
whoever designed this place should be shot .
there is no lobby to hold people before a show .
there is no question that it has everything you could want .
that 's where the praise ends .
and it 's not just coffee , and not just target .
they 're banking on this lack of competition .
now , maybe you do n't care .
they clearly do n't bring them in at the end of the night .
the lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious .
walmart does n't even make you do that !
this was an expensive skirt , completely ruined .
very disappointed .
just do n't take your dry cleaning here .
costco was closed so i went to giant eagle .
do n't waste your time , or risk your health .
go to any other pharmacy in town , avoid giant eagle .
went to barnes and noble waterfront with _num_ books on my list .
it 's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows .
i do n't remember her name which is usually not a good sign .
rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders .
so , i settled on the hummus appetizer .
all in all this place is n't that bad .
drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow .
thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back .
bar louie : you are dead to me .
the place was near empty and there were three waitresses .
_num_ minutes later , our food and the bill arrived .
worst part ?
however , i gave this place two stars instead of one .
let me just say that this used to be a place i loved .
i ca n't say the food is bad .
i will say i still ate them so shame on me .
there were fruit flies everywhere .
because of number two our service in general was not good .
the _num_ of us got to bar louie at 8:30 .
i wo n't be going back .
i very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first .
outside of that bar louie leaves a lot to be desired .
to me , that is beyond ridiculous .
the absolute worst service i have ever had at any bar or restaraunt .
and , in looking at other reviews , i am not the first .
it was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing .
servers are chatting , not paying attention to tables .
worst serves ever .
it 's expensive , the food is so so .
skip it .
there were also plenty of empty tables .
this should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction .
the server was nice , that is not the issue .
the issue was how grossly understaffed they were .
our server , was friendly .
my husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me .
both drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol .
awful acoustics !
bobby and i came here after dinner and sat up at the bar .
maybe i 'm just salty about the wait .
not even a large one , either !
but good lord , they 're just so loud !
i always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard .
not cool , bar louie .
not cool .
food was _num_ out of _num_ for this type of bar / restaurant .
service was extremely poor and bar service was also extremely poor .
_num_ mins .
i wan na love bar louie , i do .
dip for the chips are cold and beer is room temperature .
the service is ok but rather slow .
he immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks .
only another _num_ minutes until he brought one martini over .
we originally sat upstairs , which was open per the sign .
the one other time that i had been there the service was so-so .
this is not one of them .
was seated for _num_ min and no wait staff came to take our order .
awkward .
the only other bartender was slowly walking around the other end of the bar .
we got up and walked out and will never be back .
worst bar i have ever been to .
she then disappeared for _num_ minutes before coming back to take a food order .
there is no excuse for the poor service and food .
the worst bar and the worst service in the area .
if i could give it _num_ stars i would .
please ... take your hard earned money elsewhere .
sat at the bar at about _num_ saturday for appetizers and drinks .
no offer to refill drinks or for water .
i made a reservation for _num_ on a saturday night .
the manager was rude .
nothing to rave about .
it was just ordinary .
all in all , this place just needs a bit of organization .
terrible service .
small flies flying around restaurant .
mortified by this , my wife and i quickly finished and left .
the drinks are very expensive but that 's every bar louie .
i spent almost _num_ minutes for some nachos .
skip this place if you do n't want to feel ill after dining .
you will have to spend $ _num_ on a parking pass .
there are just too many misses in my book though .
he pushed me and took all the chairs .
an adult area would change all this .
the weekdays are bad enough .
i 'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer .
the lazy river could be much better .
dont waste your time with this place .
long lines , overpriced and no shade or cooling spots while you wait .
you 're better off with a garden hose .
disgusted .
just sad there customer service sucks .
my sister for a deal for _num_ and day in the _num_ season .
i paid _num_ at my local giant eagle .
thats not really a big deal .
that is a downfall .
we did n't do the lay river however because the lines were ridiculous .
people are rude there as well .
some horse play and such .
$ _num_ locker .
i really hate this place .
all of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go .
just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong .
so after several more wrong turns we finally get home .
absolutely terrible night .
otherwise , i would suggest staying far , far away !
please do n't eat this food .
fried rice super bland .
chicken was slimy .
service was indifferent .
no repeat visit for me .
rice is a little plain but i just add some soy sauce .
general tso had no flavor .
not crispy at all assuming thats why it was so fast .
only reason i would go back is speed .
meh , i 've experienced better is an understatement .
somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why .
i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard .
waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks .
disappointment .
so sad .
i order the jack daniel 's chicken and shrimp with just fries .
the chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer .
even the water tasted weird .
nothing special just around average !
went with _num_ others for a weeknight dinner .
i ordered a burger , which very overdone and dry .
the place was pretty dead and we were seated right away .
fridays seems to have gone down hill .
my burger was well done and dry .
i was sad to see how far down the quality of food had gone .
the wait staff did n't even acknowledge our party of _num_ .
my experience at this friday 's was not what i was expecting .
this beer is like champaign and it makes my whole stomach nice and cold .
why was my beer warm ?
better than that , why was my pot sticker appetizer in my beer ?
i did not find this funny at all !
i really do n't know why i bother with chain restaurants anymore .
when the salad arrived , it did not look like the picture .
it was disgusting .
not only was it disgusting , but it cost us about $ _num_ .
it was ok ... very mediocre .
i 'm sure there 's still a lot of room for improvement , however .
avoid this place !
i really never want to return .
food was ok had a steak w/ shrimp side ass mashed potatoes .
the menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive .
but later the service was not all good .
bad bad service .
was very disappointed with the food .
how does this place still exist of every place on the waterfront !
possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is .
service was just barely adequate on this visit .
it sure is n't the food .
too much dressing in a salad that did n't even fill the bowl .
only in a pinch .
ca n't handle basic cleanliness then this is not a place to eat at .
we woke up late and missed the breakfast hours of our favorite place .
it was around 11:30 and the restaurant was mostly empty .
it was ok but not something i would order again .
my husband 's salad , italian chopped , was better .
it had huge chunks of tomatoes , sausage , and cheese .
for something that took so long to get it should have been hot .
i managed one bite and was done .
what we came away with from this experience is to leave .
do n't try to stay when the experience is that bad .
interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already .
i understand , you ca n't try them all .
no one .
um , i 'm not asking you to help me sort things .
i 'm not holding up a line .
i have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before .
i have never visited a store with such a bad staff .
i hate this place .
our drinks and my soup came out immediately .
i did n't know what it was and did n't want to know .
i ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server .
it was thick and gooey and the flavor did n't wow .
i saw no reason to continue .
the skins were a bit thick and doughy .
we finished our dumplings .
this food , though , it was n't good .
i just do n't understand how anyone can like this place .
we tried going early , late -- it never made any difference .
the front staff was rude , and the wait was too long .
they could n't tell us when we would be seated .
after _num_ minutes we gave up .
i had the singapore rice noodles .
the fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw .
sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick .
the service was annoying .
there 's nothing really wrong with it .
the food is sooooo bland though .
last time we were there the server was horrendous as well .
it was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died .
but it 's soooooo bland !
they were also playing _num_ year old pop music really loud .
come on -- this is an `` asian bistro . ''
i was extremely disappointed by the lack of presentation .
our party arrived about _num_ minutes before our 5:30 reservations .
however it was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck .
i get there , look at their giant selection and get excited .
we sat at the bar and the female bartender was miserable .
we ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did .
do not sit by the windows because it was very cold .
nothing was comped and no manager was available .
this pf changs needs new management !
it 's not worth the headache .
drinks were not good .
below par on every way .
the phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door .
did n't say a word to us .
will not be back there -- rude hostess !
it 's fake asian food .
terrible experience !
very bad experience .
i started with a cup of their wonton soup .
on a scale of bad to good , it was kind of meh .
none at all .
never going back to pf changs .
the only thing this place has going for itself is the decor .
the service was not that professional !
the service was terrible .
we waited almost _num_ minutes for water glasses to be brought to the table .
when my dish comes out , it 's literally just steamed veggies and rice .
no tofu , no seasoning or sauce .
not going back .
not going to recommend it to anyone .
disappointing : ( i expected more out of pf chang 's .
would n't go back .
i you want chinese go to how lee , or china palace .
if i had to use one word to describe my experience : depressing .
when we got to the table , we were hoping for a better experience .
there were no complaints with the chicken , the only star of this evening .
the beef was disappointing to say the very least .
my only regret is i can not leave a 1/2 star rating .
it was bitter cold outside .
i asked our server why they had n't mentioned this when we came in .
i quickly ate and left to make my movie .
this is the second bad experience i 've had at this particular location .
i 'm not against p.f .
chicken was very tough .
my boyfriend ordered the hot fish , but it was way too salty .
not much more , but enough to make it not right .
instead , my total was about $ _num_ .
bottom line , enterprise ca n't be trusted .
not at this location , at least .
i 've had bad experiences here a few times now .
bad service all around !
really , you do n't get much for what you pay for at panera .
its not very good at all .
service here is pretty bad .
i ordered chicken tortellini pasta and chicken noodle soup .
panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant i have ever been to .
it did not even look appetizing .
stopped by sunday morning .
the light roast coffee was cold .
the steak was ice cold .
the slice of tomato that i had them add was not ripe .
panera quality should be consistent no matter what location you visit .
very disappointing considering their pricing structure .
do not eat the pastries !
yuk , i said that 's disgusting people have to eat that .
she reluctantly gave me the owners name .
service here has gone considerably downhill .
needless to say , will be my last time going there .
i just felt i was rushed out of there .
am i the only one ?
target reminds me of hills when i was a kid .
my experience here was not great at all .
watch out when it looks like something is on sale .
white slim fit shirt looked ridiculous .
his jacket did n't fit and his white shirt was worse than mine .
he said , oh about $ _num_ or $ _num_ .
i 'm shocked , never thought men 's dress clothes were so pricey .
first of all , the store was messy .
okay , i get it , they work on commission , but seriously .
needless to say , she would n't leave us alone .
my husband said , i 'm looking for some dress shirts and pants .
if it would have been me alone , i would have walked out .
however , i knew my husband wanted to use the gift card .
i did n't get it .
continuing on , check out was a nightmare !
worst customer service .
it 's not that delish .
this store has such bad service .
the service staff are rude rude rude .
save your money , shop elsewhere .
i love bbb ; however , this location is terrible .
maybe they should pay me for this responsibility .
my gut just tells me not to trust e 'n ps .
so i wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff .
strawberry pies being the exception to the rule .
there are better places to eat for the same money .
ugh .
it seemed like every single employee was around _num_ years old .
the service was very slow .
my drink was never refilled .
basically the whole experience was pure torture , which is disappointing .
being next door to corporate you would have higher expectations .
the breakfast bar is lame .
the pumpkin creme pie looked like it was sliced by a _num_ year old .
if i remembered her name , i would definitely mention it in this review .
it 's a hit and miss .
this location though has horribly slow service .
it 's not .
does n't matter what time we go .
get your hosts and servers on the same page !
poor service from the door .
i walked in and was ignored .
possibly the worst dining experience i 've had .
no apology .
she simply said that sometimes they are n't told when someone is seated outside .
extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it .
this has to be the worst restaurant at the waterfront .
it is appalling to see what that place has become .
i will never go back to that place again .
unfortunately , that was the high point of this service .
the waitress there are extremely rude .
good cheap food .
horrible service .
had to wait _num_ minutes before our waiter to even acknowledge us .
he then was really rude and never gave us napkins or forks .
did n't get any refills .
the coffee was stale .
i recently went into this eat n park and had a horrible experience .
how can a restaurant not have proper seating for its paying customers ?
trying to eat `` fresh '' pineapple with no wine just breaks my heart .
much closer to bland than anything .
the meat was extremely bland , with very little seasoning .
i talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side .
i was highly disappointed in the service , and i only ordered take out .
no offer of water , or a drink .
_num_ staff members yelled .
she then rings me up .
when i go to eat my meal , utensils were not included .
very disappointing experience .
will not be returning .
not good .
not good .
this appetizer was recommended and was garbage .
why _num_ star ?
went there last night about 5:30 , the place was maybe half full .
sorry but not going back there again .
the service was mostly friendly but i was disappointed in my meal .
my meal was way over cooked .
had lobster bisque soup not to good .
the scallops were hard , over cooked .
shrimp had no flavor .
it took so long to get , we just left .
whoever gave this place _num_ or five stars must be out of their minds .
bad decision .
the chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes .
the crab cakes were definitely frozen , and not made from blue crab .
zero flavor and dry as hell .
stringy , asian crab that was definitely pre-made .
terrible .
very disappointing easter dinner .
five minutes later the $ _num_ easter special came out .
he was very rude to us .
his poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday .
however , the service we experienced was terrible .
good food , but i wo n't be in a hurry to go back .
first time in pittsburgh on biz and staying in the waterfront district .
too many other good choices nearby to give them a second chance - sorry .
disappointed .
i gave it twice and no one bothered to contact me .
stay far away from this place .
what a disappointing easter dinner .
five minutes later the $ _num_ easter special came out .
he was very rude to us .
his poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday .
very disappointing .
the restaurant was about half full , i was with one other person .
chef 's special was penne in a light alfredo sauce with crab and shrimp .
it also was served at room temperature .
i had the scallops with stir fried vegetables .
the garnish had cheese on it the first time , not the 2nd .
penne was mediocre at best .
service -- - probably the worst service i 've ever had there .
never did get a refill on iced tea .
sorry to see this place go down hill .
may not ever go back .
will not eat here again .
party involved said it was fine and asked me not to say something .
it was good thing we was on vacation so we had time to waste .
unfortunately service and excellent service should go hand and hand .
the quality is completely gone , portions are smaller , prices higher .
the server even tried pushing a diners club program on us !
why would anyone even pay for such lousy food ?
the place is not even kept up anymore .
my silver was even wrapped in torn linens !
even the staff is miserable anymore .
i am sorry to say i did not get it .
i ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and was disappointed .
there were five very small shrimp on the plate .
the shrimp were dry and overcooked .
the crab stuffing was mostly stuffing .
i did n't see a piece of lump crab anywhere .
for the prices at this place , i had hoped for so much more .
i will not go back .
her reply `` no .
it was n't terrible , inedible food , it was just ... .
not good .
the only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice .
this is simply a customer service review .
_num_ minutes later we had still not been acknowledged .
gave it _num_ stars cause the wait staff was nice .
not even a ceiling fan in sight .
a few uninterested waiters wandering in back .
we finally just walked out to go elsewhere .
very bad purchase experience .
after further consideration , this store does not deserve a _num_ star review .
i do n't see to many options in pittsburgh for sporting goods .
i would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products .
this is an older dick 's sporting goods location .
these a holes .
glad they have plenty of shorts to buy when its _num_ degrees outside .
not surprisingly , we left without purchasing anything .
convenient bank hours though til _num_ pm .
no hi , no thank you , no have a nice day .
and i quickly remembered why !
forget the fact that mcdonald 's food is n't great .
we all know it 's not great .
... seriously , how does one even mess that up ?
world .
the owner has to be the problem .
worst mcdonald 's ever .
this review is more for the repair end of bbb .
where i am at , really there is no delivery but these guys did .
this crust , while thin , did not have flavor and was hard .
_num_ stars for being cheap and delivering .
the pizza , even when plain , is very greasy .
usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese .
also they do not take credit or debit cards .
there are better options .
when i started to eat , it tasted just as odd .
sorry allison b , ai n't no butter here .
sorry just had my first taste of pierogies plus .
the potatoes tasted very bland almost like dried mixed .
not my cut of tea .
unfortunately the food was n't very good .
i was served over cooked eggs with raw bacon and the biscuits were stale .
as far as i know they are no longer open at this location .
it was around 2:30 and empty .
the pork fried rice was actually pork burnt rice , nasty ( _num_ ) .
i also ordered boneless ribs , which were pretty good .
not a lot of fat on them .
menu is very basic .
the patty was sorta flavorful .
the toppings were in the bland category .
giant eagle is one of pittsburgh 's more expensive grocery chains .
management there does n't care !
visit another club , this one is n't it !
not good .
the service , on the other hand , was terrible .
avoid at all costs .
arrangement was just ok .
i will not order from this place again .
i would give our experience zero stars .
whatever it was , it was gross .
the chicken nuggets come out under par .
i recently posted a photo of my chicken ranch club .
that has no chicken .
this is ridiculous .
delivery is slow and not even close to the best chinese in the area .
try house of lee instead .
hands down , this was the worst we 've ever had .
but when it does , you bend over backwards to make it right .
not at this place .
too bad .
this family of _num_ wo n't be visiting china sea ever again .
leftovers .
the woman who answers the phone is kinda rude .
yes this is also a con because i threw it away .
just very greasy , very salty , poor excuse for chinese takeout .
i was hung up on twice before i could even get my order out .
that 's why i gave it two stars instead of one .
if you have any common sense at all , please do n't stay here .
do not stay here .
horrible !
i ca n't even rate this place !
i was forced to stay a night here and it was so disgusting !
i woke up with bed bug bites all over my body !
bed bugs would n't believe me i had to show my bite marks .
off to star nails we went .
unfortunately , the good feelings did n't last long .
i hate to rate a local shop down , but man my toes hurt .
i was rushed out and my polish was n't even hard yet .
while the place itself looked clean , the stylist 's rolling cart was not .
if i could give negative stars , i would .
terrible !
ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday at around _num_ o'clock .
worst fast food i 've ever been to .
after taking her to another vet , i was educated about wound care .
after she was treated properly , she healed quickly .
he cried constantly when i left his sight .
hoping to get a different vet next time i took my other cat there .
you try holding a scared cat in a room full of dogs .
my pet 's annual visit was over well $ _num_ .
also , do not take their facebook page seriously .
they do not care about animals .
disgusting .
i am not changing my review nor am i removing it .
they do not care about animals , at all .
this vet is only out for the money .
an average price , i 'm ok with that .
i think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients !
i could n't believe it .
this place is the worst , and i have never even stepped inside !
i needed a cut so i went for it anyway .
pie looked it it was sitting out for a day or _num_ .
i will not return to this place again .
shame on you lincoln to run a bakery like this .
almost all of the tires sold on site are foreign .
i 'm sorry , but you get one star for that .
i ended up buying american tires for the same price elsewhere .
everytime i eat at this location i end up with a sick stomach .
i do n't have that problem at other arby 's .
it was even slightly cold before i reheated it .
neither the brown sugar bacon and beef nor the blt had much bacon .
for a sandwich advertised to have delicious bacon , this fell way short .
the little bit of bacon it did have was burnt .
overall , this made a horrible day worse .
based on this experience , i would not go back .
based on this experience , i would most definitely not recommend this to others .
this store sucks beyond belief !
second of all , and more important , the service here is terrible .
you 're not doing as any favors by staying here .
first , i 'll walk you through my experience .
the customers and the staff are miserable at red white and blue .
the clothes are priced far higher than other such shops .
nasty !
do n't waste your time or money !
there are much better places to shop for thrift in pittsburgh !
i have never been treated so terrible in my whole life .
deciding not to get it , i placed it on a near by shelf .
i handed it to her and walked out .
i do n't shop at stores that hire such terrible staff .
they really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room .
just so bland !
my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich , which he loved .
i however , ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed .
the pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible .
when i picked up the sandwich grease poured from it .
needless to say i do n't think i will be returning .
this place is overpriced and the service is not good at all .
not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby .
we will not be back .
if i could give dr. murphy less than _num_ star , i absolutely would .
the new dentist could n't believe that !
do not go here -- find another dentist .
not a fan .
tonight , we walked in and went up to the counter with our beer .
no `` thank you '' or `` have a good day '' .
it was a weird experience .
i had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer .
the owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service .
do not take your dog there to be groomed !
at our table and then left prior to ordering .
bad idea .
what a disappointment !
evening started pretty badly and did not get much better .
we had reservations for _num_ people at 7pm this past saturday .
two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess .
when the rest of our group arrived ( on time !
she told me it would be awhile .
fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks .
service was rough .
long waits and lack of attentiveness .
not sure pino 's will get a repeat visit .
bland food and poor service .
there were no open tables , despite having reservations .
no such luck , since it was prime dining time on saturday night .
pino then literally threw our menu 's at us , and walked away .
not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience .
the food here is ok but not worth the price .
$ _num_ a glass of garbage wine ?
$ _num_ dollars for a plate of pasta , really ?
went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition .
i probably will not return .
listen folks , it 's cold when the sun goes down .
our server was nice , but not attentive at all .
the worst part of the night ?
needless to say , we were disappointed .
the place has changed and not for the better .
though the food was adequate , it 's not the same .
sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment !
we chose an option for each course of the very limited restaurant week menu .
baked eggplant caprese : the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess .
i do n't know where all the positive reviews are coming from .
there was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way .
all of it was overpriced and below mediocre .
i wasted my money , and i will never , ever go back there .
i do n't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother .
well , i have never felt more embarrassed in a situation .
i said he was being rude to my mother , a paying customer .
sorry , how can you not have $ _num_ in change ?
very disappointing meal .
salad was average at best .
he kept loudly requesting a credit card and the women did not have one .
after my visit last night , i have no desire to ever go again .
at this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter .
i could n't finish my dinner i was so mad .
sorry , we will never step foot in here again .
probably one of the worst places i have been to recently .
i wo n't be going back .
after _num_ minutes , i left .
when make turns , there is noise from front wheel .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
take a hard right down aisle _num_ and then you hit the bakery .
_num_ . )
from the bakery , you walk along a long meat wall .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
you 're not going every which way to try and find things .
the set up is ridiculous .
at night it is a nightmare .
ugh .
walked out without making purchase .
it was like a window into hell .
i will never step foot in that store again .
some are very slow .
the customers do n't make the experience any better .
_num_ cents .
avoid .
employees are unhelpful and rude .
i wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy .
_num_ minutes later , we were done .
yes , just like a bad date , we were done in _num_ minutes .
it was messy .
terrible !
the cut was terrible !
i have an awful experience .
the eggplant was soggy and not great .
price : tasty is cheap .
atmosphere : typical chinese takeout place .
would i go back again ?
there 's zero ambiance , offers quick take-out and the service is rude .
i ordered the kung pao chicken and crab rangoon .
sadly , they prepared kung pao beef instead .
it 's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food .
it 's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order .
tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold .
not tasty at all .
never received my order and was left in a bad mood .
the sweet and sour chicken was disgusting .
it was a neon pink color and tasted like dried out chewy dog food .
there 's $ _num_ down the drain .
i wish there was a zero star option to give .
first off , everything was dripping everywhere .
the entire bag was a soggy mess .
i 'm not even sure they bothered to cook that .
next up , the `` general tso 's bean curd . ''
the only thing they did n't mess up on our order was the rice .
it tasted and looked like rice .
holy bat balls did this place have bad food !
nothing but flavorless , americanized chinese food .
very kind , gave me minor changes without question .
zero flavor , zero filling , frozen wan tons ?
they most certainly sat in broth for hours .
i could n't even pick them up .
they fell apart .
watery sauce , no heat .
just bad .
the worst part of it all .
see pics of giant balls of noodles that tasted like the burnt curry .
price does n't matter to me at all , though .
it was just inedible .
all noodle , no filler .
avoid if you want anything but americanized junk food .
unfortunately i did not get to experience these things .
the service was slow and lukewarm .
also , no credit or debit cards here .
i also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good .
i 've tried a lot of pizza places and this is so bad .
the crust is not homemade , pretty sure .
it was n't very hot either .
i am definitely going elsewhere next time .
this place has the worst service i 've ever seen .
i called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be _num_ mins .
i had to leave without my order after _num_ minutes .
very inconvenient in a world where cash is pretty much on the way out .
they lost my breakfast business that day .
worst pizza i have had in my entire _num_ years of life .
tasted like sauce and cheese on toast .
i would n't eat this pizza if it was free .
this was one of the worst dinners out i 've had in recent memory .
olive garden seems like fine dining compared to this place .
not the crusty italian bread .
no dipping oil with herbs and spices .
it was _num_ % breading .
i can barely taste any calamari or zucchini .
again , no herbs and spices .
for the entree , i ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti .
i could n't even taste garlic in it .
what kind of italian food has no garlic ?
service was slow , but there was only one waitress in the restaurant .
she was generally nice and probably embarrassed for serving such crappy food .
$ _num_ , including tip .
even with this voucher i feel like i paid too much money .
this shell station is horrible .
_num_ ) this place is ghetto .
why not ? ''
it 's frustrating because they also do n't particularly need to work hard .
zero effort , and a horrible attitude .
it 's a gas station , how hard can it be ?
it 's clear that they do not care at all .
i 'm never going back , and you should n't either .
do not use their car wash .
this was a big mistake .
horrible experience .
i was rear ended at a stop sign , was n't my fault .
i would n't recommend them to anyone .
called two days later to confirm it was ready .
`` no , it 's not ready yet .
days passed and no call .
left and halfway home , `` check engine '' light came back on .
please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards .
so now i have a very sick kitten on my hands .
poor little guy .
this also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future .
bad shelter !
no `` i 'm sorry . ''
they kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh shelter .
weak leadership .
this is a terrible shelter .
that 's probably how they got so sick !
my poor baby went through hell .
never again will i take my dog there .
she was sick six ways to sunday .
i hate that place and everyone in it .
i 'm very disappointed .
so i have no gripe with the tailoring itself .
so beware , you are paying to dollar !
i was in a time crunch , so paid anyways .
my suit coat came back ruined !
at that point , i had n't put two and two together yet .
so i went back first thing the next day , and showed the tailor .
it makes no sense .
i 'm just not crazy about the vibe here .
let me repeat , never again .
the primary reason i used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions .
hence , i am now here , writing this review .
the times i 've been here , its been an ok experience .
however , their store hours are absolutely terrible .
this place is a disaster .
it 's almost been _num_ hours and i 'm still waiting .
ridiculous .
-they did not install tires correctly .
booked an appointment , and they fixed the issue .
i do not recommend .
last time i ever set foot in that place .
i will not be returning in the future .
went in to have a slow leak fixed on a tire .
no one could look at it because they had an appointment at _num_ .
one person working and could n't look at my car .
no appointments available for tomorrow .
fail !
poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own .
was trying to find a rating lower than _num_ star but could n't .
this guy seems nice but he 's actually not .
something does n't sound right here .
the light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy .
the people who work here are very rude .
i am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there .
i will not go back again .
a little pricey but whatever .
the sandwich was just gross .
the coffee was just a little off .
no wonder mine was stale .
seriously , all the people here have major attitude problems and need an adjustment .
their sandwiches taste terrible as well , they 've always been terrible .
seriously , fuck this place .
i just do n't get why the floor is like and ice skating rink .
i drink this beer regularly , and something was wrong with the beer .
i 've had the pork nachos and they were blah .
our server was friendly , but not terribly attentive .
i would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night .
i ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions .
it is a shame because buffalo blues does have potential .
the sandwich left something to be desired .
buffalo blues was neither .
not particularly interested in returning for any reason .
very classy , wish i could remember her name .
bar food none too exceptional .
we had nachos that were on slightly stale chips .
it was humongous but not that tasty , pretty dry .
bad texture .
it really is a pittsburgh staple but come on ... .
food is really , really average .
it , technically is in shadyside so your mercedes will be safe !
it 's loud as hell !
there seems to be no consideration for customers at all .
but as long as they got their money ; they could give a crap .
want to sit in the bar area ?
also it 's loud as hell !
to put it lightly ; the staff suck !
it pains me to leave any tip for them .
it is way too expensive .
oh how the mighty have fallen .
something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad .
since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable .
food is very overpriced though .
and , its not good .
some of the salads are alright , but its just not good food .
we did n't eat anything so i ca n't comment on the food .
my husband and i went to buffalo blues last night .
after what seemed like forever , my husband got up to find a server .
he literally walked around the restaurant to find someone , but could n't .
when we said no she said she would be back .
such a waste of time .
i hate this place .
so the max you could eat is _num_ wings .
the wings do not come with celery .
apparently this was a bad choice .
however , i hate it because i believe the alcohol and food is overpriced .
so , it 's not really much of a win at all .
unfortunately , the service we were given ruined our overall experience at buffalo blues .
my husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap .
the restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar .
we will not be back .
the food was awful , the service worse .
we ate two each , then told the server we did n't want them .
at least the place was quiet -- there were empty tables everywhere .
and the quality of them are bad .
unfortunately every time i wish i was somewhere else .
the hot and sour soup was ok.
this is an average chinese buffet .
and it all is so bad .
the chicken in the chicken and broccoli was so small and it looked disgusting .
the sweet and sour chicken looked like drops of hard , fried batter .
came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot .
they said it would take another two hours to start work .
i came in with a flat .
so no , no thank you .
they fixed the flat no problem for $ _num_ .
guess that cracking was n't so bad after all .
you should always have your car washed , specially in the winter .
i was quoted $ _num_ for them to get it off .
avoid this shop .
but after what happened i will never be back .
they just cost me money and lost my tires .
put the tires in my basement , no problem .
they call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size .
because you could n't fit me in within a day i get screwed ?
every single time i go through the drive-thru i do n't get a straw .
i do n't know how this keeps happening .
i do n't think i 've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people .
too bad after all these prior good reviews .
extremely rude and condescending over the phone .
unfortunately , i hung up feeling like a major inconvenience .
the sad part about this is they really try .
do n't expect great performances here , expect a talked up mediocre performance .
this apple is too green to eat much less pay for .
my pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright .
i also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake .
while i 've been to better bakeries , i will definitely be back .
if that does n't work , then they try to scare you w/ it .
or the fact that you 'll save sooooo much money by being a member .
granted , it was a friday morning , but still .
and nobody smiled at anyone else .
as i said above : it 's worse than the bureau of motor vehicles .
unbelievable .
it 's been a tremendous ordeal to get it fixed .
another employee tried to help me fix it and screwed that up too .
i do n't quite trust anybody else to help me properly .
there is no option for zero stars so i was forced to give one .
_num_ weeks later , no title ?
for some odd reason , local aaa offices dont post their phone number online ?
naturally , i get an automatic voicemail .
and again naturally , no return phone call .
cant wait until aaa calls me to renew my membership .
if i could give negative stars i would .
i should know , i 've dealt with at least a dozen .
times , and it still is not resolved .
why did you return there if you were so unhappy , you might ask .
if you are in the aaa , you 'll know i 'm calling .
if i could give negative stars i would .
i should know , i 've dealt with at least a dozen .
times , and it still is not resolved .
why did you return there if you were so unhappy , you might ask .
if you are in the aaa , you 'll know i 'm calling .
worst experience .
slow , rude , unhelpful , and completely clueless .
my soul purpose to coming here was to get my license picture taken .
not here .
complete waste of life .
going through aaa is a bit worse than your average dmv .
the guy who processed our registration was patronizing and slow .
he also made a mistake that required fixing after the fact .
i called aaa and the service and follow-up were both appalling !
so the air in tire was wasted time .
no one has gotten back to me yet .
horrible treatment .
bad facility , even without a trash can in the room .
i never seen such a rude person in this county so far .
seems like she do n't wanted to take care of the customers .
place was a little bit of a disaster .
its easy to be dissatisfied and rant about a customer services organization .
so i drove _num_ hours there on a weekend to renew .
having a _num_ hour drive wasted didnt make it any better as well .
sad to say the other reviews i read of this place are accurate .
there were zero other people here aside from my friend and i .
fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things .
i feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter .
i 'm certain they notice , they just do n't care .
i came away with none of it .
the staff i dealt with could not have cared less about helping me .
do n't care .
very disappointing to me .
the customer service at this location is terrible .
overall , shopping there is a poor experience .
fairly mediocre , even by the relatively modest standards of home depot .
tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency .
fail .
i really like this shop .
all the sales associates are extremely useful and educated .
avoid this place .
the employees are nice but i get the sense it 's managed terribly .
it is difficult to get in and out of their lot as well .
they hired people that had to be required to do certain areas correctly .
terrible dry cleaners !
poor customer service .
i will never go there again , and i recommend you do n't either .
they do not take pride in their work .
they also lose things , more than once .
do not take your clothes there because they will damage or lose them .
simply awful !
as promised , they were ready monday after 5pm .
additionally , they did not smell so well .
the worst $ _num_ i 've ever spent .
avoid at all costs !
they 've ruined my clothes on _num_ separate occasions !
i want you to know i 'm not just an `` angry customer '' .
instead of _num_ .
very rude and condescending .
but we did n't have that problem until we left their lot !
and then there was another lady that was complaining about their service too .
do not take your car to midas !
they place no value on customer satisfaction .
furthermore i week later i found my car 's belt system was broken .
i made an appt online for 6pm the following day .
he said no because we didnt discuss it .
seriously how to you mess up a simple oil change appt in multiple ways .
- the usual crap they sell to people because they think they are idiots .
refused all of those .
seriously just do n't do it .
had a _num_ am appointment and was told it would be a hour wait .
the front desk clerk said that it should not be much longer .
slow service and response .
linda is a quite arrogant woman with bad attitude .
not recommend .
provolone sticks arrived undercooked , cheese was fully solid , they tasted okay .
worst pizza i 've had in pittsburgh .
i felt sick before i got halfway through it .
that reminds me - the slices are huge , and are $ _num_ .
sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated .
i also should have known that i should n't have cheated on my diet .
not sure what on the salad made me feel this way .
but i 'm not liking the effect i 'm getting right now .
i got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone .
to say the least , i was disappointed in my soup .
but their pizza was remarkably terrible .
i pay my $ _num_ and wait .
i could n't stand to eat more than half .
went home , made some eggs , and guess what ?
the terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago ?
i 'm not making this up .
terrible pizza .
just plain gross .
the crust was all gummy and the cheese tasted like plastic .
gross , gross , gross .
the crust was hard and flavorless .
this was a mistake .
avoid this place at all costs .
never again ... .
how utterly disgusted i was with it .
i spent days on the toilet after eating the pizza .
my appointment was at 8:30 am , i was on time .
i sat in the waiting room until _num_ am .
i waited _num_ mins in the lobby .
not cool !
now i am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load .
and at least i put my cart back .
now it 's just more expensive .
worst parking lot in pittsburgh .
try $ _num_ , for real .
waste of time and money overall .
parking at this particular store is a nightmare .
you treat the employees like dogs - like one level above dirt .
oh whole foods , you are so so very overpriced .
but i just can not bring myself to do my normal grocery shopping here .
you may even get a nasty look , yikes !
okay , i 'm going to a negative place right now ... .
even though i was only there one time , first impressions are a bitch !
the food : plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying .
all i got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless .
i 'll stick with trader joe 's for my alternative market , thank you !
it really does n't hit you , until it ... hits you .
it 's why they have parking lots in the first place .
i 'll be honest , i just do n't get it .
i spent a lot , but i was ok with the occasional splurge .
not cool .
overpriced and overwhelming .
i made the mistake of going -- once -- on a weekend .
maybe i 'm just not the kind of person that likes whole foods .
if i could give them zero stars , i would .
then told me it probably did n't start because it was sitting so long .
yeah , that sounds like `` nothing 's wrong '' .
do not bring your car here .
i spoke with brian at the desk who was very polite and professional .
sunday went by then monday went by .
then i had to pay them $ _num_ to get my suv back .
i had to pay them to waste my time and do nothing !
this was not in the lease .
_num_ ) they did not return my $ _num_ security deposit .
they never reached out to me , not once !
i would caution against this rental company .
i 've basically been told i 'm not getting my security deposit back .
that 's not a life i 'm comfortable with .
wish me luck guys .
ridiculous policies and move out fees .
please take all of these negative reviews seriously because they are valid .
they do everything they can to charge you extra fees .
the management is horrible and never understanding .
hot & sour soup was highly americanized , not very hot or very sour .
did they use the tea pot as an ash tray ?
cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags !
the current tenant informed me that the roof leaked .
we just turned around and walked out at that point .
i would give him a _num_ start rating .
have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders ?
the wine list did not include descriptions .
disappointing .
the waitress was very curt and disrespectful .
overall , i just was n't very impressed with the food .
there was no information about this .
food is mediocre at best !
they even screwed my order .
asked for risotto and got some pasta , not sure what .
would not recommend to anyone .
they have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly !
i do n't get it .
i am upset to report that this tasted rather bland .
i am sad to report that this too was tasteless .
the ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish .
more frustrating than conversations with the wall .
total waste of $ _num_ bucks .
also , their bar seating sucks .
i ca n't believe all the high reviews .
the food tasted terrible .
if you like casbah more power to you but for me never again .
bill was $ _num_ without tax -- pricey by my standards for this experience .
the new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night .
we were disappointed with our entrees .
my roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot .
not a good vegan experience .
i again had offended by my request .
overpriced , salty and overrated !
it was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable .
the pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok .
the manager on duty came out to apologize , which i did appreciate .
i do n't think that casbah is my favorite anymore .
no thanks casbah !
we were willing to try again , so we went for dinner tonight .
i sent that back , and ordered the sea bass .
needless to say , i will never return to this restaurant .
- ambiance is nice , upscale , not too loud .
only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them .
- mushroom pasta : again quite rich and salty .
that was n't to be .
i 'm so disappointed .
i would hate to lose this place !
wait time : we had a reservation , so we were seated right away .
not worth the price .
main dish : long island duck - too salty .
it is dark , so do n't expect to take any good photos .
i wish i could give it more stars , but really it was disappointing .
heavy and bland .
the service was also extremely slow .
_num_ minutes to get our bread and _num_ to get our appetizers .
wrong it was smaller portions at a higher price .
i never felt so ripped off .
$ _num_ for one meatball and three bites of pasta .
- this really was the standout .
so , i had been wanting to try this place for some time .
it was awful .
anyway , i 'm never going back here .
sub par at best , go to any of the other big burrito restaurants .
this is the worst fucking experience i 've ever had at a wine room .
i am standing waiting for our table _num_ minutes past our time .
i tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment .
sooo wrong .
thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table .
the burger and `` spicy '' cajun soup were very mediocre .
i 'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over _num_ years .
every time i have ever gone , the service is awful .
i really , really wanted to like this restaurant .
i 'm not really a messy eater , but come on !
maybe part of the problem was expectations ?
learn from my mistake .
it 's never too loud or aggressive .
the food is inconsistent , but often good .
their food , service , and hours are inconsistent .
owners , please stick to your business hours .
it 's not like you 're open that late to begin with !
... my vote is to just stick with the hours you created .
yes , my food was tasty ( _num_ on a scale of 1-10 ) .
however , from the get go , our host was absolutely terrible .
he did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward .
to be fair , our assigned server was very nice .
but of course , our food came and mine was cold .
it just was n't anything special .
needless to say , i will not be coming back to this place .
it tasted like nothing .
anything will taste better drenched in gravy .
on top of all this service was n't the greatest .
also they do n't really wash their cups .
it made me not want to drink my water even though i was thirsty .
good idea , but poorly executed food .
for a vegetarian place , there was nothing green on our plates .
worst tofu scramble ever .
days old , cold , hard , inedible .
sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish .
i 've found the service here to be pretty terrible .
sorry storm , you need to improve this .
if both of those conditions are n't true , then go anywhere else .
i 'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant .
yep , that description of their `` chorizo '' comes directly off their menu .
but do n't expect that feeling here .
two stars because i really like the drinks here .
this place is a train wreck .
the food is bland .
the service was pretty bad .
i think pittsburgh deserves better .
there are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this .
personally , i was n't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza .
if not , stay away .
do n't waste your money !
i was pretty disappointed with this place .
the fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless .
overall , i would n't go back .
i was a bit disappointed with the pizza i got .
i 'm not watching my weight -- i can handle it .
probably not ordering from here again .
pizza is pretty bland and there is nothing remarkable about it .
the pizza was n't bad , but it was n't great either .
given the relative quick delivery , it was on the cold side upon arrival .
also , i had ordered a fried pickle appetizer .
here 's the catch ... there was no sauce !
they literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us .
we tried bbq , garlic parmesan and spicy .
but this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was .
the outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little .
the wings were the most mediocre wings i have ever tasted .
final verdict : most mediocre wings in town !
could not understand what the foreign cashier was saying , made placing near impossible .
rude .
rude .
rude .
they do n't speak english and they do n't understand english .
and they are rude .
also the driver forgot to bring my drinks .
the vet met with us for a very short amount of time .
she seemed tired , and overworked .
all in all , this was a negative experience .
imho that 's ridiculous .
i will not recommended anyone to ever come here .
i was forced to locate another vet when i adopted a new kitten .
being treated extremely rudely by reception was the final straw .
thanks , but no thanks .
it is unfortunate .
however , i recently missed an appointment .
it is unfortunate that they have such a rude office manager .
this is not a place that a neighborhood should support .
ugh , my coworker spread open the spinach leaf .
the store seems to be a kind of a ripoff .
there was some improvement for awhile , but it has gotten worse .
they 're actually worse than some large corporate stores in these areas .
just got off the phone with a lady from construction junction .
normally , i have had the best experiences there .
my husband can not go back to construction junction today .
i am able to help move , i just could n't do it alone .
not anything like the pieces on the floor .
just thought you should know .
worst customer service i 've seen in a while .
+ _num_ star because they are finally installing air conditioning .
- the fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here .
worst climbing gym i have ever been to .
customer service was a joke .
first of all , the gym in pretty cheap .
even a small crack with a few problems set on it .
the staff was n't very helpful .
it 's poor form .
they are n't rated properly , just easy , medium , or hard .
i would n't go there again .
they told me that they charge _num_ dollars a hour .
the filet was decent but not $ _num_ worth of decent .
it was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories .
apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town .
i imagine less than _num_ % of expensive restaurants today are cash only .
the lamb burger was also overcooked .
very pricey food , cash only , average food .
these people could not care less .
ridiculous .
rude , unprofessional , and lazy .
the lady i spoke to was rude and unprofessional .
so when i got back to the office , i went online and checked .
nope , it said $ _num_ for a master stylist women 's haircut .
did n't she have my slip with the card number ?
it was n't the cut .
_num_ years i had this deal going on .
needless to say i have n't been back but would recommend in a jam .
sadly , the professionalism of the front desk never got better .
i was going to have so much done , too !
i 'll spend my money elsewhere !
i waited _num_ minutes and finally walked out .
receptionists were beyond awful .
i booked _num_ style appointments in advance for a wedding .
i waited _num_ minutes while being ignored by the receptionists .
i 'm not paying $ _num_ to get rushed service .
more unbelievable , i waited _num_ minutes to pay for the two services .
no wonder they need coupons for customers .
i did n't stay to find out how the haircut would have gone .
he also went on to give me the fastest haircut i 've ever had .
poor planning .
i will never return , to make any other purchases .
big waste of time and gas .
they do not have ice cream , only soft serve .
wow are their servers just lazy or dumb ?
this place is n't very good .
wo n't be going back .
i do n't understand the big hype over this place .
i 'm also not a fan of soft served ice cream .
a good family dollar this is not !
and they smoke around the food .
water glasses stayed empty for almost _num_ minutes !
ordered _num_ dishes , all pretty average .
i wo n't be back .
service is incredibly slow .
not worth it at all .
once seated , i practically had to beg for a wine list .
the cab was taking forever , so we called a different company .
as my boyfriend was talking with the cab company , a waitress walked by .
despite how great the food was , i wo n't be returning .
so disappointed .
i had a horrible experience .
at that time , i even had a terrible interaction with the owner .
this time , overpriced food and bad service .
this is a bad neighborhood .
i am not interested in ever going back !
not happy about the new staff .
the main reason for the low rating was the service .
that was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us .
sounds weird , but i never felt so rushed in a _num_ hour dinner .
i also did not like that we were seated at a high top table .
the biggest disappointment was the veal chop .
the disappointment was it was over-cooked .
not a spot of pink to be found .
just clear me out and get on with the next one .
crappy place .
i made reservation and still the table was not ready .
i am definitely not going to the place again .
everything else was yucky .
avoid !
i would not recommend working with dollar bank for a home mortgage .
my new goal is to deter anybody i know away from dollar bank .
i was totally underwhelmed .
this place does n't feel clean or inviting .
the decor was junkie and old and cluttered .
but sadly , i do n't see you at all in my future .
i got a fill and a fix because i broke a nail .
i was very uncomfortable the whole time i was there .
one of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me .
i will not be returning again .
they are n't very friendly there at all either .
not a bad place to get your nails done .
too over priced for mani and pedi .
terrible customer service !
but got the invoice three days before i got the estimate .
truly , you do n't need this kind of grief .
anybody that is not would be totally screwed by these people .
the quote was $ _num_ dollars .
one quote $ _num_ , another quote was $ _num_ .
needless to say , i will never be going here again .
my night was ruined thanks to this pizza hut .
i waited _num_ hour and _num_ minutes for my pizza to be delivered .
then when i got it , it was cold !
this is the worst chinese food i have had in a long time .
there were no other veggies or anything .
it was all mushy breading and very little chicken .
i ate _num_ bites and threw it away .
needless to say .
i wo n't be getting one again .
the pizza was bland , tasteless .
crust tasted like frozen pizza crust .
sausage was disgusting .
i do n't know what this sausage was other then disgusting .
why would they want to risk a customer not coming back .
these women are old middle aged miserable employees with no passion for their jobs .
i wo n't be back .
i was absolutely horrified !
if you have any alternative , though , i would avoid this place .
i am definitely not going back to complete the transaction .
do not go here for service on your bike .
maybe i just had a bad day .
this was the worst `` pizza '' i 've ever had .
this is not even worthy of the name .
first bite the crust was almost raw , dense , and way too chewy .
there was no third bite .
the remaining slices got tossed in the garbage .
this was by far the worst `` pizza '' i 've ever had .
if zero was an option that is what i would rate them !
they are the worst company to ever deal with all they want is money !
zero if that was an opinion .
this place has the worst service i have ever seen .
he was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and pepsi .
it seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant .
recently it changed ownership and sadly the results are horrific .
not even a simple `` i 'm sorry . ''
needless to say we will never go there again .
and we could have been loyal customers for years to come .
also the ambiance of anthony 's is not the same .
very disappointed .
would n't recommend at all .
the quality was horrible .
the sauce was not a good flavor at all .
i had to wait _num_ hours just for a pick up for this crap .
the pizza bagels were soggy yet burned .
and the prices too high .
biggest waste of money !
i ordered a bacon pizza and breaded mushrooms .
disgusting is putting it lightly .
i threw the whole meal in the garbage .
it 's a shame , what happened ?
that is completely ridiculous .
it also does not help that they do not have beer prices listed .
one star for the ridiculous overcharge .
it was not good .
the hummus was okay , and our main plate seemed to be microwaved .
for dinner , not that great .
even though the groupon included menu items , they do n't have a kitchen .
they can keep the other groupon .
maybe they can use the money to buy some real food .
sales person treated me like i was a very inexperienced .
the owner is very pretentious and rude .
i am never going back to this place .
very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city .
unfortunately , this is the only game in town .
makes me glad i live in new york city .
they gave me a nice receipt .
one week later i call , not ready .
the following week , they would call me back .
other than losing your stuff , they seem like nice guys .
service and products are lackluster .
overall , not a great choice .
in addition to being condescending , they hung up on me .
actually that is n't quite accurate .
neither one greeted me or asked me what i would have like to order .
she served the beer in a mason jar .
the food is n't fresh .
it was n't pan fried either .
my sides , german potato salad and braised red cabbage , were equally awful .
i did n't have more than a bite or two .
that 's total bullshit .
food was mediocre at best .
bland is the best description .
wo n't be back .
what was set in front me looked nothing like what i was used to .
sadly , i just did n't like it .
i thought it was actually not very appetizing at all .
what i was into was the german potato salad .
i was highly disappointed .
it was bad ... the you ca n't drink it kind of bad .
my husband has eaten there before and was sorely disappointed as well .
i really want to like this place .
it was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots .
reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat .
makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is .
the restaurant is located in a tired part of town .
for starters , the food is always served cold .
do n't believe me ?
yesterday they were undercooked , gritty , and gross .
in fact , all of the food is becoming gross .
you need a new chef , immediately .
if you want bland tasteless food , then stop here .
they need to get out of the _num_ 's with the decor .
beware of the ketchup .
then , they did n't even do anything to make it up to me .
not even the potato pancakes tasted good .
i 've had better meals at the complimentary continental buffet at the holiday inn .
who knows how long that sour cream had been sitting out !
my water glass had onion pieces in the bottom of it .
not a fan of this `` german '' place .
simply awful .
very low quality food for the price .
the only good part was the bacon , which was ok at best .
i have not a single good thing to say about this restaurant .
the service was terrible , took _num_ min to get a water .
we ordered the turkey reuben that tasted funky on day old potato pancakes .
we also ordered max 's famous reuben , nothing famous about it .
worst .
everything ready in _num_ seconds because it sat under a heat lamp .
avoid at all cost .
potato pancakes taste like they had vinegar in them .
disappointed .
it should n't be this way .
if this is personalized service , i 'd rather stay at a motel .
even without grumpy old man , there 's nothing special about this place .
everything else was sub-par .
the dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful .
the hotel is in a bad neighborhood .
ugh .
about _num_ % more expensive .
why even keep this historical , old , dingy , dirty room ?
i was very specific when i made my reservations several months ago .
but , hey , i can always catch up on my sleep tomorrow night .
just bad service overall .
no one to help with bags morning or night .
even the day front desk person was short with us and rude .
i could n't wait to get out of there .
i would n't stay here again .
we never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying .
then refused to call m & p to talk to the manager .
i have terrible foot pain and can barely walk .
very disappointed that i can not be seen sooner .
do not believe he cares about his patients .
horrible food , horrible service .
the italian and mushroom steak hoagies were n't that great .
the steak was so chopped that it kept falling out of the bun .
the pizza was n't that good either .
$ _num_ for _num_ '' italian and $ _num_ for _num_ '' mushroom steak .
i will not get anything from there again .
it was like getting a shitty breakfast in a local sub dive bar .
ron 's pizza palace is cheap .
on multiple occasions in the past , i have ordered hoagies from ron 's .
the produce in their hoagies is as bad as their salads .
i wo n't be ordering from ron 's again , despite the inexpensive menu .
with ron 's , you are better off considering fast food .
inconsistent again .
the last _num_ hoagies i 've gotten here is again only mediocre .
the bread is the best part , which is really sad .
was going to try the buffalo pizza .
no longer going to try .
and ... i was pretty underwhelmed .
fortunately , i 'd gotten that info when i ordered .
would i have had to call in to sort out their staff 's mistake ?
and the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired .
no such luck : it came on her sandwich just like everyone else .
i really do n't know how this place got any good reviews .
i got food poisoning and was so sick .
needless to say i refused to pay for them .
the 4th time my friend dragged me there , i had a salad .
it sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint ... '' oh that place ?
at this point , i am done .
its just sooo unprofessional and annoying .
so dissapointed and will never use them again .
this week is the 3rd week .
estimated delivery time _num_ minutes actually delivery time _num_ minutes .
pizza hut , a pizza of last resort .
estimated delivery time from an online order : _num_ min .
do n't bother with delivery here .
this is the worst location .
two hours and i 'm still waiting on a slow sunday night .
really bad service !
food is ok but horrible delivery service .
they called on the wrong number despite we have given the right one .
horrible horrible service .
small , overcrowded , unfriendly staff .
the food is okay - typical italian fair that could be better seasoned .
the shrimp and pasta , however , were cooked well .
the mozzarella was unremarkable , deep friend mozzarella in breading .
of course it was good , it is fried cheese !
but it was nothing special .
prices were inflated for a limited valentines day menu .
never again , they are off my list .
if i could give this restaurant a zero , i would .
do not go to this restaurant !
their food was mediocre at best .
i will not be going back .
went for the first and last time tonight .
$ _num_ corkage fee for _num_ bottle of wine .
the restaurant is so small and they have a problem with managing customers .
the food was less than average .
we ordered an app and unfortunately this is where our problems began .
they brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks .
but this was quickly corrected .
but unfortunately they had already sold out of the special .
i give them a _num_ for presentation .
so i guess i did a good job at picking out the wine .
but did nothing to make up for it .
soups could have been a bit more full in the cups .
the worst thing about this place is also sam .
the only redeeming quality is the young girl who works here .
does not honor national sub day offer .
too late to back out .
this giant eagle maybe the worst supermarket i 've ever been to .
worst grocery store i 've ever been to .
to make it worse , they are supposed to open at _num_ .
one thing i like about the store is the proximity to my house .
it 's close to my neighborhood , hence the _num_ star .
but seriously , it 's like walmart stuff at whole food 's price .
but overall the store is way too pricy - for no good reason !
when i want to cook pretentious gourmet food , they have every ingredient ready .
my recommendation was to burn this place to the ground .
the produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good .
the store never looks very clean .
however , the quality of the produce from my experience is pretty poor .
the lines are always long and take forever to get through .
furthermore , the stuff in the bakery and goodies are below par .
i 'd recommend stopping in another giant eagle if you can .
i 've had a lot of bad experiences at this store .
i talked to him for _num_ minutes and he was polite and friendly .
such a shame about this place .
the store itself seemed really outdated and stinky .
waste of time .
i dont even bother coming here anymore .
all bad news .
went to this store today and it was worse than usual .
i 'm too scared to shop there after dark .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
i wish the north side had another option but we do n't .
giant eagle should be ashamed of this establishment .
if i was _num_ i would have beat his ass over that .
like who goes from _num_ 's to _num_ 's in _num_ days ?
horrible customer service !
owner takes no responsibility for ruining clothing .
they had a dj so there was a cover of $ _num_ - boo !
for those that know me , i 'm not the gambling kind .
it was n't overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks .
saturdays there is a cover for the dj which was $ _num_ .
however some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross .
my jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke .
for some reason two drinks came out to $ _num_ .
however , i ca n't let this slide : your claw machine is bullshit .
that 's a lot of beer for less than _num_ dollars .
the worst customer service ever !
i normally do n't do this but i 'm so disappointed .
if you care about your natural nails , stay away from this place .
i do n't eat at this restaurant very often .
i 'm glad i do n't eat at this restaurant very often .
i really was n't thrilled with our meal here .
the breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable .
the pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though .
i hope the owner or general manager reads this .
service is mediocre and slow .
waitress was ok in attitude .
that 's _num_ minutes to be next .
manager embarrassed himself .
how hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms , seriously ?
the penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor .
the service is terrible .
i do n't know if they hate working there or hate serving people .
why be in the service business if you have a bad attitude ?
i have been here a couple of times and it does n't change .
i 've never had a staring contest with a hostess before .
it 's bizarre .
so if you 're a horse you wo n't go thirsty .
this was ridiculous to us so we left !
ugh , i hate this place .
people from work drag me here to lunch more often than i would like .
the service is snotty and slow .
the food is forgettable and the menu sparse .
i tried the seared ahi tuna .
but do n't go for the menu .
otherwise , food and prices are not worth a stop .
it is n't a bad experience .
maybe it 's just the built in crowd .
crab fries , naturally .
was n't the best either .
service , small selection and mediocre food .
ca n't comment on any other time but this really hectic one .
not a degree above room temp .
limited menu .
my reuben tasted like eating a salt stick .
service was fast , but the salad and cup of soup were disappointing .
the chopped salad had weird cheap ingredients like celery and carrot .
but let me tell you , i was highly disappointed .
first of all , our service was awful .
but now i 'm weary of the restaurant all together .
i was meeting up with _num_ other people there .
not even to just get drinks or an appetizer ordered .
i ordered a hamburger with fries for $ _num_ .
very disappointed .
it took over _num_ minutes to get the order .
the meat was very dry and falling apart but not over cooked .
awful place , to bad i was looking forward .
we only wish we would have ordered food and then left .
try as he could , he could not do it all .
a party of _num_ , we agreed to sit _num_ and _num_ .
i was wrong .
no chicken .
not even one piece .
no potatoes or any other filling except a few peas .
extremely disappointing .
service was slow for soup and a salad .
mediocre at best .
went to easter brunch , was served some coffee from a can .
i do n't understand how this place is even in business .
if this establishment were to be in any other city they would be closed .
this place is a fusion of olive garden and red lobster .
was n't very busy which was a plus .
did n't matter that our food was n't correct and our drinks were empty .
bathrooms were dirty and ladies room had no toilet paper or soap .
service is terrible and wo n't return .
i was really excited to hear that they had smoked salmon .
however , when we got there the buffet was well picked over .
i was mostly wrong .
the food was not great and not worth the price at all .
it came out of the kitchen with noodles instead of the potatoes .
but that should be explained by the waitstaff when someone orders the meal !
we also waited over _num_ minutes before someone even took our order .
going downhill ... ... man , what happened to this place ?
unfortunately our waiter was not up to par .
it is difficult to get under my skin .
house salads for the wife and i which were pretty standard .
we also got a chicken ranch flat bread and this left us disappointed .
that is $ _num_ month from august to march .
they probably knew we would n't have the money for a lawyer .
we spent $ _num_ on admission & parking for _num_ adults and _num_ kids .
we will not be back .
we feel like our money was wasted .
the only downfall was their delivery time .
good food , but rude service on the phone and in person .
i tried pickles tonight for the first time .
i called ahead to order a gyro calzone and was told _num_ minutes .
it was another _num_ before i got my food .
in a bad frame of mind , i tried my food .
i did n't have an issue with the place or the other patrons .
from the food to the prices , you could n't find better .
i 'm thinking we 've struck out .
first of all , ordering was strange .
wow ... we 're we disappointed .
the crust was super doughy and the cheese was pretty gross .
do n't do it !
the bones are small and barely have any meat on them at all .
they do n't take debit or credit cards .
never open when you need it , unreliable availability with his products .
you disappointed me .
i have been a steelers fan as long as i can remember .
so not cool steelers !
my friend lives near here so i came to satisfy my deli sandwich craving .
it was bad .
it made me kind of sad .
o my pittsburgh pirates .
i warn you dear pirates -- it wo n't be pretty .
another losing season .
but was a winning season too much to ask for ?
you also used pay phones because you did n't have a cell phone .
i 'm no fair weather fan , but 20+ years of losing is enough .
what a disappointment .
they topped off my coolant for free and changed my oil .
he asked me if i had $ _num_ cash on me .
i ai n't going back where they treat customers like that .
which is pretty sad .
was so excited to get your pizza today .
very disappointed in the quality of what i got .
how sad is this so not happy .
used to be the best i 've ever had .
wise guys is your typical off beat pizza shop .
there are no frills , there are no items i would particularly recommend .
there are other better pizza places in the area .
the hostess was incredibly rude directly off of the bat .
it was just as lousy as the lunch .
unfortunately , the second visit was n't any better .
the place smells of smoke .
gross .
walking on it with shoes on disgusted me .
the walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place .
do n't get the salmon or tuna steak .
both tasted very fishy to me .
mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes .
do n't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes .
i get it , you wan na have a mom and pop shop .
apparently with this kind of reception , no one wants to pay full price .
mom and i both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese .
overall , it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich .
the place is dated and could use updating .
her first bite she made a sour face .
my son and i then tasted it ... understood the face after that .
the pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there .
the breaded shrimp tasted weird too .
needless to say , none of us finished our food .
for a $ _num_ dollar meal , it was n't worth $ _num_ .
no , just no .
they told a driver must have taken by accident .
terrible .
ordered twice in the last _num_ days and both times it was terrible .
both were crappy , at best .
staff was really rude both times .
he just said `` sorry man '' and did n't offer any solutions .
it would 've taken very little effort to fix it for us .
too much cheese on their pizzas , and the customer service is incredibly poor .
it 's a shame .
all it would have take n was a new pizza and wings .
$ _num_ a week plus gone from them .
she claimed they did n't deliver to his address which was _num_ mile away .
remember , the call was on speaker so i overheard both sides .
my friend was not rude , not disrespectful , just looking to order food .
hard to contact .
walked off the job and all the work completed was not done properly .
also , alcohol in the air here too .
very disappointed .
original post written september _num_ - i do n't recommend this company .
poor quality work .
i would never use them again .
very disappointed .
delivery was late , our gyros were cold and fries were soggy .
this was probably the worst gyro i have ever had .
ok atmosphere drinks are overpriced for the area .
it was so dirty i could barley contain myself .
the staff completely ignored it .
this is a gathering place for human garbage anymore .
check my purse , yes , but leave my purse with complete strangers ?
it just left a bad taste in my mouth .
years and years of spilled food / blood from the meat department and etc .
had a friend who went here .
the owner is the one who took my appointment .
they are a hot mess .
i came in tonight ready to buy a bike .
i was really disappointed .
the only people getting help in there tonight were two other guys .
what a terrible experience .
i 'm glad i took my money elsewhere .
disgusting & totally unsanitary imo .
i 'd go back for bottled beer , that 's about it .
i hate writing a less than stellar review of a business .
this is where i get a serious case of the sad .
the bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence .
it happens !
that 's sort of disappointing but still fine .
the owner refuses to take care of black people .
not sure what people see here but it 's a never again .
it was busy but at times could n't find her .
i had an ugly haircut .
for $ _num_ with the owner .
this time around i am extremely upset .
karen left the color on my hair way too long .
the worst of it is the damage caused by being over processed .
i would like to say that i am only disappointed by what 's happened .
i very much regret ever trying this salon .
when i arrived , i was seated quickly and greeted by a stylist .
what a complete waste of time .
they told me it was it was because i was booking with the owner .
i 've had appointments with salon owners and never had to leave payment info .
i was not a fan and probably wo n't be back .
this was my second visit and alas , my last .
as for my ca rolls , the avocado was all brown !
avocado is like banana .
not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever .
needless to say , we skipped dessert .
our first visit deserved a _num_ but this visit was a _num_ .
i was not impressed with the sushi either .
i would not recommend this place .
always seem to be people going in and out .
the shrimp lo mein was ok but the shrimp was overcooked .
the moo shu pork was forgettable .
yeah , do n't order from here , unless it 's for dumplings .
everything else we had sucked .
shrimp and scallop with garlic was bland as hell .
i only took _num_ bite and did n't want anymore .
the wonton soup i have to say though was very good .
the chicken lo mein and fried rice were okay .
nothing special .
the price was fair and the delivery driver was nice .
i probably wo n't order here again though .
horrible food .
it 's hard to get a good chinese restaurant around pittsburgh .
person on the taking orders was rude when i called back with a problem .
this place has ok food and bad customer service .
terrible .
no .
she refused .
a completely clueless one , that 's what kind .
she simply said `` ok '' and walked out of the room .
meaning , i never saw her full face .
or maybe i 'm wrong .
the answer , so bad !
it 's all cheap but that 's not reason to be terrible .
only once was it under par .
how about horrible customer service ?
long time customer and disappointed to say will not buy from them again .
absolutely horrible way to treat a customer when they were the ones in error .
apparently they feel that frozen cakes are acceptable for events .
thanks for the disappointment to me and my son !
this place is the worst motel i have ever stayed .
this was the worst hotel that i ever stayed in .
i was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed .
horrible place !
pretty rough , but not completely unbearable .
the location is n't ideal ; on the side of a busy highway .
the overall condition of the hotel was n't promising on first entrance .
the room continued to be unimpressive .
- no visible signs of bed bugs .
probably not .
it 's dirty and weird .
the free breakfast is as bad as it gets .
( old cereal and bread . )
i fall into the later category : i did n't like it at all .
the salad was ... nothing short of horrific .
eventually , i found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below .
i do n't get this place .
sorry , but our pizza was cold .
and the garlic wings did n't taste like garlic .
some customers may like it , me , not so much .
they put oil on the sandwich , but no other dressing .
i expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed .
my date ordered a hot sausage hoagie .
the bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart .
it looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich .
the dining room is also a bit cramped .
hungry patrons also are constantly getting up to visit the soda fountain .
this was just bad pizza .
for the money i expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza .
also the mushrooms were out of a can .
do not waste money here .
i guess a lot of people like it , and more power too them .
but i do n't get it .
way too much cheese .
the pizza crust tasted like pizza hut .
i did n't even know you could get canned green bell peppers .
if answer is yes , then maybe this place is for you .
it is definitely not for me .
this `` pizza '' was the worst food i have ever eaten .
i do n't get it .
cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza ?
why does pittsburgh have to be so weird ?
no professionalism .
_num_ cents per slice for every topping ?
not a medium .
no way .
a ton of cold shredded cheese thrown on top of pizza ?
no no no .
no beer either .
whoever recently took over , should be ashamed .
worse than store freezer pizza .
terrible .
, i would have never known .
had this pizza been cooked , i feel like it would be subpar .
i would n't take somewhere here as a pittsburgh destination though .
did n't live up to my expectations at all .
waste of time and money .
it does n't work .
man was this place packed !
however it just does not work for me .
rude .
if i could rate it zero stars i would .
i ca n't understand how this place stays in business .
i disliked the cold cheese and cold pepperoni on so so crust .
not comparable to the other top ten pizza joints in pittsburgh .
i really wanted to like this place but alas it just was n't happening .
they put way too much cheese on everything .
i know , you say , how can one possibly have too much cheese .
totally my own fault , but still , watch out .
went for lunch for hoagie , fries and _num_ cuts .
would n't recommend .
he employees walk by dirty tables then people sit at them .
my daughter and i ordered my pizza slices to eat in and hers togo .
after finishing mine , we inquired about our take out .
what they said was `` i do n't know what you 're talking about .
terrible experience !
stay away unless you 're just buying tires !
very disappointed with this dry cleaner .
i do n't normally get my beer from there .
small dark not very opening or friendly place .
will not be returning .
the only good thing was free parking out back .
had n't even read the reviews beforehand .
it was karaoke tonight , not my fav but whatever .
mediocre and poorly made !
i would give this eat n park location zero stars if i could .
i did not receive water or any service for _num_ minutes .
do n't waste your time .
it 's fairly disgusting ( sticky tables , trash everywhere ) .
dairy queen only serves two flavors of ice cream so this is fairly unacceptable .
we tried to explain this and the clerk said nope , not allowed .
if i could give this place less than one star i would .
but the customer service is by far the worst i have ever experienced .
i would never give these people my money again .
this is by far not true in this store .
the service is rather incompetent .
it would have been nice to know whom .
ca n't understand the big secret about that one .
it is still in plastic and there are no burn marks .
i was grateful for justin since he was the most helpful to me .
so consider my advice if you decide to purchase here .
this was done _num_ years ago .
i ca n't believe this place has n't been reviewed .
nothing more , and nothing less .
my girlfriend and i came to have some dinner around _num_ pm .
sadly , this was the last time that she ever came to our table .
we sat and waited for more than _num_ minutes .
will i come back to your restaurant , i 'm not sure .
it went to voice mail , so i left a message .
support local businesses , but make sure they are deserving of your money !
atmosphere is awesome ... food is terrible .
no flavor , soggy french fries , over sauces wings .
_num_ minutes later my date had finished his meal and my fries were gone .
my breakfast burrito tasted like nothing and a our food was cold .
the only good thing about the experience was the warm donuts .
poor service , crappy food .
overall not the way a restaurant should be run .
i would give this place half a star if i could .
the service was the most appalling i have ever experienced .
do not order steak or prime rib here .
the prime rib , ordered rare , was medium , dry and extremely salty .
the rib eye was thinly cut , salty and dry .
the bill was $ _num_ so it is pricey .
i was very disappointed and would not order anything but wings here .
the fourth got his about _num_ minutes later and his food was terrible .
cold .
stale .
then , she sat _num_ small parties there .
bad idea .
this place is a bad idea all around .
lots of tv 's and ok atmosphere so i will squeeze out _num_ stars .
very disappointed in this place .
we are never going back .
this place is sad .
but all of the pretzel bun sandwiches are n't that great .
fishy smell .
not fresh at all .
also did n't seem very nice .
very annoyed and ignorant !
this place is empty ... .
and _num_ bbq dishes .
not hot at all ... .
server kim was awesome .
but kitchen has a lot of problems .
the variety of sauces is what gets me to come back .
i 'm sure it would have been great !
the gravy ( breakfast gravy ) was warm , however everything underneath was cold .
i am not exaggerating in the least .
anything dealing with food is a train wreck .
i may come to have drinks , but never to eat .
you 've been warned !
if i could less than a star i would .
service was extremely slow to begin with .
go figure cooked , but cold .
they ended up making a new one and the wait was over _num_ minutes .
one minute later all of our food was delivered cold .
it 's also really expensive .
it 's not worth the money .
the place had a great location but otherwise it 's a waste .
it was a place where everybody knew my name .
i would always suggest it when friends asked me where to go .
i can not speak for others .
all that money spent elsewhere because of one power trip .
will never go back !
asked to refill my coffee and got a cold one .
unbelievable .
average bar food , slow service , a nice selection of incredibly overpriced beers .
go to the original pancake house about _num_ minutes away for a better breakfast .
pancakes were not very good .
average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive .
very small and uncomfortable .
dont fall for it .
especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm .
such a waste of time .
i think we waited about _num_ mins , which was n't bad .
our waitress had n't stopped by our table in a long time .
no hint of a smile on her face .
are we really hungry or really impatient ?
i dunno .
maybe the waitress was having a bad day .
everybody told me i had to try and their pancakes .
well , the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes .
i do not get the hype behind this place .
it was just average and did n't really have any taste .
it came with mashed potatoes which were definitely from a package .
the worst part of this last visit was the service .
after standing there for a couple minutes we were then given our check .
i wo n't be back .
i stopped in on a whim alone and sat at the counter .
i did not finish my meal and got up and paid and left .
i am not sure if i will go back which is really a shame .
i ate less than half of the meal and left .
i would n't go back .
urban spoon rated _num_ % favorite .
this pizza is not good .
the hype surrounding this place will probably lead to your great disappointment .
i would n't order a pizza from them again .
now it 's just crap .
not a dime every again .
almost three days later , i had n't heard back from them .
my biggest issue was the attitude i received when i called .
so he ca n't bother with mine .
i would n't recommend this mechanic to anyone .
having curly hair , i 've had my fair share of terrible haircuts .
the one i had at this salon was among the worst .
the owner clearly has no idea how to cut curly hair .
it all could have been so easily avoided .
it does n't feel fair .
not nice !
i am not impressed .
mediocre food service and atmosphere .
bland reheated samosas .
barely reheated naan .
obviously that feeling is long gone .
clearly she had a nasty cold and should 've stayed home that day !
i 'm not sure what was worse food or service .
oily , greasy and bad taste .
shockingly bad .
the young waiter was ok but clearly scared of the woman .
the old woman was not nice .
that said ... for _num_ people , my lunch tab came to $ _num_ .
for an appetizer , _num_ entrees , and naan .
no drinks .
so , i will never be back .
which is sad , really .
i wish i could give them _num_ stars ... total waste of money .
food was so bad that i threw it in the trash .
hope no one falls sick after eating food here .
food was terrible .
all tasted like old food .
hope no one falls sick after eating food here .
also the food was bland and pretty much flavorless , very disappointing .
needless to say , we will never return !
severely disappointed .
i ordered chicken curry .
this place is pretty bad .
the food is n't fresh .
terrible place to eat and not very clean at all .
_num_ $ for a plain roast beef forget that !
i was desperately hungry late one night with no other options .
my guess is that it was that suspect sauce you put on that sandwich .
i ordered two chicken finger kids meals and two adult meals .
had to pull forward and wait another ten minutes for food .
when i got home they did n't give me my kids meals .
the place is crowded and cramped too , but not unpleasant .
sadly really went downhill .
the bloody mary was pretty awesome for what i assume is a pre-made mix .
i also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell !
iceberg lettuce , croutons , cucumbers , and dry swordfish .
lame .
she also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average .
hostess was very awkward when seating us .
i just feel like i 've had much better pizza elsewhere around town .
one of the worst steak sandwiches i 've ever eaten .
everything is basic with a large price tag .
rude , unfriendly , just a miserable male server .
there were _num_ of us .
it was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese .
unfortunately , the hair did not stop there .
luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight .
however , the reaction that we received was unacceptable .
very disappointed in our delivery order this evening .
the wedding soup was less than fair .
thee buffalo chicken sandwich had no lettuce or tomato on it .
the reuben and fries were soggy and greasy .
it was a disgrace .
disappointed .
worst waitress ever .
could n't remember anything .
husband ordered penne chicken vodka sauce .
it was runny and bland .
would not go back .
the same plain pizza we order never seems to taste the same .
the fries were ways very soggy and cold .
i want so badly to like this place !
but the last three times the staff has been awful .
horrible drink ( old fashioned ) ?
spaghetti -- huge amount , no taste ?
noise level -- painful ?
i 've been wanting to stop in here for the longest time .
pizza , sandwiches , beer , what could go wrong ?
well , it was n't horrible but it also did n't blow me away .
all in all , very disappointing in our book .
delivery guy was shady too .
i did n't bother to ask if anything was organic .
i do n't like this place at all .
i do n't recommend at all .
no apology or explanation , just a bad attitude .
however once opened not so much .
i wish there were negative stars i could put for this place .
i have never been treated that way with any owner of a business .
unbelievable .
as it is right now , do not patronize this business .
there was absolutely no excuse for his attitude .
got a bang trim , a low # _num_ cut , and a wash .
i showed the lady the picture of my desired bang .
she went ahead started to cut my bang after looking at it .
are you kidding me ?
and i replied , `` no , i 'm sorry .
it 's not what i was looking for , but thank you '' .
this is the worst company as far as billing & customer service are concerned .
when you try to cancel it takes forever and they are rude !
* no shopping carts .
salad will come first , then a couple of dogs , then fries .
now , their service : really lackluster .
the waitstaff all seems to think highly of themselves .
hardly saw any of that today .
fries are nothing special .
the worst part , though , is the service .
you practically have to beg the waitresses to pay any attention to you .
and i do n't even mean refilling your drink .
however , check the price of a beer before you buy it .
but not $ _num_ for _num_ standard size dog good .
not a good value in my book .
probably wo n't be back .
shame on me .
check out the better business bureau ( bbb ) .
are you kidding me ?
we were leaving to go _num_ miles away the next day for the wedding .
now , after picking up my dress we realized they ordered the wrong size !
the size that i ordered required zero alterations .
after calling every day for a week i was furious .
he barely let me talk and continuously spoke over me .
the downside : the alterations were very expensive and very poorly done .
awful customer service !
she was sooooo rude .
a voice from downstairs says `` i 'm down here . ''
she then starts up the stairs and says `` no go upstairs . ''
and then she said `` no , what kind of dress . ''
she took me into the room of dresses and said to look around .
they ca n't even give you the courtesy of trying on their dresses .
so i had high hopes that my _num_ ( ! )
but getting to that point was one disaster after another .
then , in june , my maid of honor calls me .
but it was not the dress she ordered .
not even close .
fast forward to july ( _num_ weeks before the wedding ) .
she said there was no time to order another dress .
no time to get additional fabric .
in the end , that bridesmaid got a partial refund for the dress .
this experience was not worth the beautiful dresses .
save yourself the headache and stay away from this establishment .
worst dry cleaners ever .
also , the staff was fairly rude and all had chips on their shoulders .
the owner ( larger woman ) is rude and dismissive of my questions .
i wo n't be coming here again .
turned out to be way more hassle than it was worth .
i left them as i was not in a rush .
this was during business hours that i was told to wait outside .
these people are totally incompetent .
i would n't trust them with a pair of socks .
do not use these people for your dry cleaning needs !
unfortunately zero stars is not an option .
there 's a reason why there are only two reviews currently for this place .
shame on you cathy !
let me start off by saying , i hate the dentist .
it is my worst fear .
and for $ _num_ that 's disappointing .
what i got was dry and totally tasteless .
the whole burger just tasted like nothing .
it was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries .
again no salt or seasoning .
rather disappointed .
i met my friend jean here , she is a once a week customer .
i chose a veggie wrap , sans cheese with a side of apple sauce .
she complained the tea was weak , i never noticed .
so why my low score ?
waited _num_ minutes for drinks , _num_ minutes for good .
food was average , service very bad .
never going back .
finally order and pull around , i wait another five minutes .
all i can really say is that she was a real ball of sunshine .
the drive through service here leaves something to be desired .
not only was my order wrong but the lady was very grumpy .
the service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse .
worst service .
slow .
bad !
real bad .
i want to know what to expect , you know ?
they do n't use their space well .
it just looked really sparse .
this is a depressing coffee shop .
there 's no smoking inside , of course , but it always happened .
i guess that is really the only thing this place has going for it .
tables are often dirty .
dirty tables , i agree with the other reviews here .
no additional fans , nothing .
i asked for my money back .
you know what was the worst thing , though ?
then the ultimate insult : _num_ kids came in selling candy bars .
well , that coffee i spent $ _num_ on ?
that is the last money i will spend in that place .
disgusting .
does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge ?
i would beg the owners to put any effort into this place .
i asked for a pen , not a kidney .
yeah , i 'm not coming here anymore .
_num_ ) they use canned whipped cream .
_num_ ) my hot chocolate was just gross .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
this place has gone downhill tremendously .
its _num_ and they still do n't take credit and or debit cards .
but they use the cheapest meats they can find and you can taste it .
pizza was fine but nothing special .
the salad i ordered was wrong , though .
and beware of the prices : what 's on the website is wrong .
this store is so gross that i was almost sick !
i will never step foot in this place again .
i really do n't get giant eagle .
he told me i had about _num_ minutes to get it .
i informed him i had about _num_ minutes .
i left my intended purchases and walked out without buying .
no reply .
six days and it cost _num_ dollars .
just terrible .
just go elsewhere .
not even remotely convenient .
one of the worst wendy 's i 've ever experienced .
did n't get all of the items i ordered and paid for !
we also did n't get straws , or utensils for our food .
nothing special , it is kmart after all .
it is dirty and the employees are lazy and exceptionally slow .
needless to say , i will not go here again .
are employees required to be grumpy here ?
they all look like they hate their job .
first off , i like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible .
the managers do n't care .
then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another .
just go anywhere else , it ca n't be worse !
nothing special .
worst applebee 's experience i 've had .
we were seated and then waited _num_ minutes to even be greeted .
and then it was only because we flagged someone down .
no apologies when we were finally taken care of .
should have listened to my gut on this one .
but i did n't have a problem with that .
what i have a problem with is all the nasty flies in the building .
and while you 're eating too ... it 's so disgusting .
as far as the menu , i was n't impressed .
but i ended up with the chicken broccoli alfredo , nothing to rave about .
another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff !
still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care .
i said no thanks .
takeout is a mess at this location .
very awkward location and atmosphere .
i keep giving them another chance and i keep getting disappointed .
it 's just rolls off the tongue , does n't it ?
i hate complaining like this .
but sometimes , you just have to , ya know ?
when she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay .
from start to finish , the entire evening was a terrible experience .
there are better hibachi options in the area .
the service can be okay or awful .
but she said no , we absolutely could not order ice cream separately .
very disappointing .
we love japanese steak houses and this was our least favorite meal in pittsburgh .
the salad dressing was tasteless , the jumbo shrimp was under cooked and chewy .
it tasted more steamed than hot grilled .
the shrimp sauce was very thick and not that flavorful .
this is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant i have eaten at .
not only was the food bad but the service was terrible .
this is the worst hibachi i have ever had .
not good .
my boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle .
i replied `` no , you never served me any . ''
by the time they were cooked , everyone was finished eating .
that does n't say too much for the rest of them .
i do n't know how people keep coming here .
there is way better hibachi in pittsburgh , for a lot less money .
benihana is not worth your time or money .
by now its nearly _num_ o'clock .
by this point we 've been waiting for _num_ minutes .
this is totally unacceptable .
the horrible location ?
the hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating ?
as we get our 2nd batch of sushi our soup was still not ready .
looks and taste both scored a _num_ out of _num_ .
the horrible location ?
the hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating ?
as we get our 2nd batch of sushi our soup was still not ready .
looks and taste both scored a _num_ out of _num_ .
fist we wait _num_ mins or so to be seated .
the restaurant was n't even half full .
our hibachi chef was absolutely horrible !
he barely spoke and did n't put on any kind of show at all !
our _num_ year old was so bored that she wanted to leave .
none of us even like onions .
the manager did n't seem to care at all about our situation .
we feel completely cheated .
since the changes its just awful .
very sad .
sometimes i ate there _num_ or _num_ times a month .
w h at a shame .
i just hate to see it .
extremely disappointed , food was absolutely awful .
our vegetables were so soft , they all tasted the same , mushy .
our chicken was flavorless and rubbery .
this will be our last trip here as there are now much better options .
it 's too bad a once gold standard restaurant is not any longer .
went for a friend 's birthday and had the worst experience ever .
no explanation , no apology , nothing .
the presentation of the food was awful .
compared to other restaurants this is my least favorite .
this is the worst hibachi restaurant in pittsburgh .
the food was cold and everything was flavorless .
the salad and steak sauce tasted like cleaner .
the chicken was also extremely dry .
this is place is no longer what it used to be .
also , they did n't have much of a sushi menu at all .
it was really disappointing .
the place was completely empty .
i was mortified , my boyfriend was mortified , the waitress looked mortified .
my brother was uncomfortable and embarrassed and just kept staring down .
he should n't have been put in that position .
shame on you benihana .
dirty place and horrible service .
loud is an understatement .
it took forever to get our drinks of simply water and soda .
what we got at long last was so disappointing .
there is much better mexican food and drink in the 'burgh .
you have no idea how badly i want to like this place .
i just have n't been impressed by anything i 've ordered there .
even the chips and salsa are n't terribly good .
even the guacamole was too hot .
it was very noisy and i do not recommend for kids .
the chicken fajita was over cooked , dry , and charred .
everything was overpriced ; drinks , entrees , and dessert .
the waiter was horrible and barely checked on us .
the food was also not too good .
it was very bland and did n't have a lot of taste to it .
i will not be coming back .
the food is n't terrible , but not impressive .
there was nothing memorable about the taste of it whatsoever .
been here a few times now , food is mediocre at best .
it 's hit or miss with this place , but mostly a miss .
the food was okay , but worst service ever .
i was really hoping that this place would have good food .
i ordered _num_ ground beef tacos with black beans and rice .
the tacos were decent but the rice and beans were horrible .
both were very dry and lacked flavor .
horrible service .
it was loud , but expected that on a friday night .
bartender came back quickly with what looked like watered down lemonade .
worst margarita i have ever been served !
described as being served with butternut squash , brussel sprouts and cauliflower .
did n't even get time under the warmer .
glad i tried this place but wo n't rush back .
sorry , bummer .
service was mediocre but the food was poor .
burnt chicken in the burrito .
there was no mole sauce as described in the dish .
this was explained to us before we ordered .
this restaurant has really gone downhill over the last few years .
have n't been here in a long time because the service and food suck !
that was one of the worst burritos i have ever , ever had .
never again mad mex south hills !
waited _num_ minutes for drink , waitress got my order wrong .
not worth the trip .
i am a ten minute drive from this location .
i attended the sushi class on monday night .
for $ _num_ per person , i was beyond disappointed .
can you give a company zero stars ?
this place makes you feel unwelcome and dumb .
just a poorly laid out store which is showing it 's age .
not laid out well .
rude cashiers .
self check out usually broken .
horrible experience more than once .
store is too small and always crowded .
managers and workers are rude and condescending .
actually just had an awful experience with a manager named chris .
i have witnessed him being rude and condescending to other customers too .
had a beer and an appetizer , so-so .
huge line at mad mex on friday night , none here .
i doubt we will go back , too many other choices .
was n't the best experience .
the food was ok but nothing to great .
not up to it 's previous brunch standards .
ugh .
if you 're not getting that , do n't bother .
at eat n ' park , free cookies are a staple .
needless to say we left , and we will not be going back .
i wish i could give this no stars !
this place was not packed .
while waiting , i used the ladies restroom .
does n't anyone come and check this ?
came back and dropped them off and left again .
your menu is n't that big !
however , there was no way i was sending it back .
i did n't even eat all of it .
i gave half of it to my husband to eat .
the fries are very salty .
rude !
either way , i am not going back to find out .
high prices , horrible service !
i only went here because i had a groupon .
huge mistake .
off to sams ... .
model cleaners failed to deliver _num_ shirts and _num_ suits in june .
after a few phone calls later , no shirts , no suits .
so , i am assuming they were delivered by a neighbor .
i then took inventory of my suits and found that _num_ suits are missing !
i will be doing business elsewhere .
so incompetent i did not even get a chance to rate the actual service .
we went for a second opinion elsewhere and i 'm glad we did .
guy on the front desk has the attitude problem .
the people all look like they hate their jobs and treat the customers accordingly .
i threw my mean in the garbage .
this wendy 's is terrible .
there 's nothing fast about this fast food .
at first i thought maybe it was a fluke .
- and they left me hanging .
but based on other reviews , even this is n't always the case .
received bad service today .
however , lots of seats since the place was empty .
we left einstein 's because it was crowded .
they missed an opportunity to impress a new customer .
repeated my order _num_ times and it still got screwed up .
my dad would always take me to this place when i was little .
i usually do not like posting negative reviews .
poor service , menu options not available , dirty utensils .
instead of the amazing tomato bread i got plain rye .
if your seeking genuine medical attention i would strongly suggest another facility .
no lab coat , no name tag , no introduction , no nothing .
i asked if he is a doctor and she replied , `` no .
their service is terrible .
i was ; however , charged for the basket .
do n't order from this shop if you want a timely delivery .
the food was cooked well , but lackluster .
have mixed vincent 's .
just goes to show , it depends on what you order .
overpriced , very slow service , food was decent .
food is mediocre service is lousy .
i was disappointed with the seafood salad .
of shrimp and _num_ scallops with very little salad greens for alot of money .
service was good but probably the worse pizza i 've ever had .
we could n't eat it .
waitress was nice but never asked to refill our drinks .
my hoagie was dry with min meat .
probably wont go back .
pizza was good but really expensive .
i also got a _num_ pack that cost _num_ dollars .
the same _num_ pack cost _num_ back in my hometown .
i dont eat meat so i ate the spinach ravioli and it was ok .
breadsticks and meatball sub for my mother .
the breadsticks were sitting a in pool of oil .
the meatballs sub , my mother said was cold and undercooked .
it was n't fresh at all .
we finally got our money back , we did n't even eat the food .
and the service just was disappointing , all for take out .
when i was little there was always enough donuts for everyone !
they know they sell out before _num_ and they only open at _num_ !
everyone hates it ... and unfortunately i drive it frequently .
as mentioned by others , this road is not in the best shape .
and this is n't even the halfway point to philly .
and there are n't as many rest stops .
fyi - prices are scheduled to go up jan _num_ _num_ .
surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business .
kmart is doing okay as is the giant eagle .
that 's not an eatery either .
i soon left and went over to olive garden for lunch .
dead malls are sad , for some reason .
walking through this mall just creepy though .
truly the worst mall in america .
going here is like being in a time machine though .
man , the rent has to be so cheap !
honestly i do n't consider this place a mall .
stay away , there 's nothing here to see .
this mall is dead !
the mall that is nearby is not really a mall .
even the atm was boarded up , which is really not a good sign .
there are also not many place to eat around the hotel .
i hate olive garden .
you wo n't find me at an olive garden back in new jersey !
i ordered food that i believed was gluten free .
within twenty minutes i started to have symptoms and was sick for two days .
avoid at all costs !
ever !
thats as american as fortune cookies .
after pasta , comes the protein , that includes meatballs , then finally salad .
i just passed six tables empty and clean .
their salads and breadsticks are the only real reason to go there anymore ... !
well it is a sunday night and the crowd is not here .
very unprofessional staff so far .
her ex must have ran , not walked away from her .
rooms were clean and the amenities were fine .
my problem is that the hotel double charged me for my stay .
i only stayed one night and was charged twice .
add on : the wifi is awful .
no manager on duty for the busy morning rush .
they are not concerned with quality of courtesy services ie shuttle and breakfast .
employees watching reality tv during business hours really puts me off .
the next morning we went down to the front desk again .
something just feels wrong .
avoid .
place is ok but a little uncomfortable .
the continental breakfast was ok but a little lackluster .
so this spot is like mad cheap but really ?
checkin was seamless as it should be .
the first bed legit has hair under the sheets ... strike _num_ .
you could n't at lease have made it look like you did your jobs ?
i assumed it was leaking and brushed it off .
there was absolutely no hot water for my shower .
so cold i would n't even consider hopping in really quick .
i was so mad .
i 'm not sure i can even give this place one star .
furnishings and bedding from the _num_ 's ... if not _num_ 's !
the hallway looks a wreck !
the tv was definitely a _num_ 's model .
there are no hotel signs ; _num_ ) .
there were no parked cars visible from the road ; and _num_ ) .
it looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees .
this was by far the worst hotel experience i 've ever had .
the lights were broken and the room was filthy .
the worst .
do not stay here .
wish i could give this place negative stars .
it begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at .
really wish i would have looked at yelp before booking here .
extremely disappointed .
she could n't tear herself away from the movie to address me .
filthy would be a step up from the actual conditions .
it has n't been cleaned in months .
i explained to her that this has been going on for weeks .
yet again , not one courtesy call , nothing resolved .
i wish i did n't have to give even _num_ star .
horrible service .
i got home and no extra sides .
i called again on july 2nd as they never sent anything .
i would be happy to get my _num_ back .
mediocre food , horrible service , zero follow through .
my advice , avoid this place .
junk worse than mcdonald .
horrible experience again made sandwich wrong for 3rd visit .
store is open until 2:00 .
she asks employee to scale back .
he refuses .
never again will i go to this location .
horrible service !
_num_ time in the row i got my order wrong .
which i do n't really need .
today i gave them _num_ chance .
for real , wasting money for wrong order !
it 's sad .
today both girls behind the counter were so rude and had zero personality .
service is terrible .
waited for _num_ minutes for a bagel with cream cheese with no line .
they other employee was doing i do n't know what .
it should n't take _num_ minutes to get a dozen bagels .
horrible service and food .
horrible customer service and they always screw up our orders .
i just do n't understand why they 're so lazy .
it 's not hard .
extremely long lines , and poorly trained staff .
do not recommend .
the baristas are not friendly .
i 'm always always always made to feel like i 'm stupid ( seriously ?
and they 're just rude .
rude .
real bad .
not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee .
no no .
and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee .
it is not daily normal , ordinary dirt .
not sure if the manager makes th e employees clean or not !
would rather go to dunkin donuts next time !
it costs $ _num_ for a manicure and $ _num_ for a pedicure .
the worst mani/pedi of my life .
i 'm _num_ .
she had no clue but claims to have been doing nails for _num_ years .
did n't know how to remove gel polish .
did n't file straight or smooth .
did n't clean under my nails after lotion .
unfortunately the worst possible thing has happened .
unfortunately i do n't know what happened ?
i 'm no longer going back .
i know some people have off days but this was bad .
by far the worst shellac manicure i have ever had .
i went down on my lunch break for a quick mani .
first the woman rushed through my `` manicure . ''
the manicure was very quick and not at all thorough .
if i could give it _num_ stars i would .
i really should have known better to walk in here .
it 's the size of a closet , completely messy , and disorganized .
but you know how some dive bars have charm ?
i was thinking this place might be like that .
i sat down in the chair for pedicure .
that 's not how it 's done in philly .
woman takes off my toe nail polish .
should n't you be doing this for all of your clients ?
shady and terribly run nail salon .
surprised someone has n't been hurt yet .
this is the worse nail salon i have ever been to !
when i said something to her about it , she snapped at me .
she was unprofessional and downright nasty .
this place needs to be closed - stay away !
unfortunately , i did not have the great experience others did .
i ended up getting probably the worst haircut i 'd had in _num_ years .
additionally , the experience at the salon left much to be desired .
something that was supposed to be a treat for me turned into a headache .
the haircut was mediocre , but the highlights were much worse .
they did n't even cover up all of my roots !
i really was sold at one point .
therefore , that left junior stylists to wash and dry my hair .
so please , i trust you to just make me look hot . ''
i hate that !
i 'm not a hair stylist .
we called to make appointments together and the receptionist was rude !
different people wash and dry your hair .
what i got was about _num_ inches taken off and no layers .
wrong !
first , i feel like they pull the prices out of thin air .
finally , overall the prices were way too high .
my husband gave me a gift certificate for this salon .
there were two girls at the front desk , neither could have been bothered .
one did n't even look up from the computer .
she offered me two different stylists by name with no other information .
that 's why i 'm looking for my cup now .
rude .
why did n't i have to show some email to get the free treatment ?
she was basically giving my asian friend a terribly difficult time .
my hairstylist was friendly but gave me a really bad haircut .
very disappointed .
will not return to this place .
once again , they were not prompt .
please do not patronize this business .
i wish it was n't that difficult .
the salon itself also disappointed me .
in addition , they offered me tea , coffee , or water .
however it wasnt until half way through my appointment that i got it .
such a waste of time and rude .
i should have known better given that it only had one positive review .
i wandered in here looking for a pedicure .
my heels still looked as bad as they did when i walked in .
very sloppy !
i would put _num_ star if it was possible !
it looked like a child had done it .
this guy is out of control its definitely something wrong with him .
also a heads up - only _num_ pedicure chairs in the place .
very limited color selection .
very poor quality work .
got a full set and the exact same thing happened _num_ days later .
they must use very cheap product to lower their costs .
pedicure 's are overpriced and they do basically nothing .
it was no more than _num_ minutes long .
do not waste your money .
i 've gotten my nails done quickly before though and had much better quality .
the staff is the most unfriendly and have a carefree attitude .
this is not the first time either .
stuck in my lease until february .
is it terrible ?
no , but you know that better is out there .
the blackened chicken wrap was boring .
the flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland .
also , white tortillas just do not do it for me .
however , i can order a salad with french fries on it .
ca n't win 'em all , right ?
ridiculous .
but , it is what it is so do not forget your key !
other times , it does n't seem so busy .
a number of the reviews here giving off the `` eh '' vibe ?
finally - a halfway decent tv setup , pittsburgh !
my boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and i got a cheddar burger .
he said the stir fry was so-so .
ingredients were spot on , but it was lacking any real flavor .
it was just so-so .
my food was plain and boring .
the place was noisy and it was pricey .
well , it was overpriced and the food was terrible .
i ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room .
very bad food and overpriced .
i wish i could give this place no stars !
no tip for you my friend .
especially considering the french dip was so boring .
no redeeming qualities here .
it was hardly edible .
i did not , however get the best .
although i would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer was n't bad .
but i really do n't think there 's much you can mess up .
the buffalo pierogies however , was a total miss .
it did n't look appetizing , nor did it actually taste appetizing .
food was flavorless , plain .
do they even have tables for _num_ ?
_num_ minutes later ... he asked his manager and allowed us to sit there .
no steak knife , no mashed potatoes , no asparagus as ordered .
will not be back .
pirates , steelers , penguins etc ?
they do not have 1/2 price apps !
somewhat slow service and somewhat overpriced .
$ _num_ burgers , $ _num_ domestic bottles .
look elsewhere there is a lot surrounding this place so you have options .
we waited for the server yet again after asking for drink menus .
absolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner .
and all of that was on a night where the place was mostly empty !
the nachos were the worst i 've ever had .
noisy overcrowded and not enough staff to cover the crowd so service was slow .
the lobster bisque was bland and cold .
the pork chop was so bitter and dry .
furthermore , it took forever just to get our waitress 's attention .
i would rather go get sushi than spend more money here .
i was disappointed the waitress did n't say anything either .
unfortunately , our experience was dreadful .
our food tasted frozen and overcooked .
what has not changed is the extremely poor service .
our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations .
all working hard , but covering too many tables .
long story short , i wo n't go back .
she thought the potato side was just so-so .
hotel restaurants are just awful !
would n't they want you to stay and spend money on their property ?
nevertheless , this place in the westin hotel is no different .
for starters , the place is sorely outdated .
the decorations look like they 're straight out of an _num_ 's music video .
the spicy yellow tail was not spicy .
the salad 's ginger dressing was awful and watery .
but it was not happening at this place !
and def not as good !
it was hardly halfway full .
so she asked for a little more from the server .
needless to say , i will not be back .
do n't say i did n't warn you !
the portions are not worth the price .
the service has been poor almost every time i went .
the salads are small and nothing to write about .
came in for drinks after a conference and could not get service .
do n't waste your time at the fish market .
_num_ dollars for _num_ people .
it all had no taste !
the steak was tough and tasteless .
there was too much rice , and presentation was sad .
service was the only redeeming quality .
a simple `` sorry for the wait '' would have been nice .
unfortunately we did not .
the food was all bland and tasteless .
it was not even blackened .
mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box .
do yourself a favor and avoid the original fish market .
a round of patron margaritas were horrible .
fish market needs some lessons on hospitality and diversity or new management .
terrible crab bisque .
the food was awful .
do not waste your money at this restaurant .
seriously , terrible .
just all around terrible .
it actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright .
i 've been meaning to go back to the fish market for so long .
i finally had the chance last week and was surprisingly disappointed .
both were not unique in flavor or presentation .
ugly .
ugly .
ugly .
i was pretty disappointed by this experience .
it was n't good at all .
it was a small roll cut into _num_ pieces ( maki ) .
so i know it 's an off the shelf thing .
basically , this was the worst roll i could imagine .
so all-in-all , the food was sub-par at best .
i 'm sure the room service would have been better .
to be fair there was n't anything particularly wrong with the food or service .
but the quality just does n't match the price .
first time i 've eaten here i went during lunch time .
not crowded but service was quite slow so i took off a star .
you 're probably asking why order that when at a fish market .
no worries probably better for me .
so they lost another star for over priced for the value i received .
the girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu .
two basic rolls and miso soup for $ _num_ .
this would easy go for $ _num_ at other places during lunch .
yes , but only if it is convenient .
i would not go out of my way or tell friends about this place .
did n't eat here ... this review not about the food .
we immediately left and frankly its not worth going back again .
shame , the fish was good there .
crappy hostess for sure .
it does n't change much .
they get maximum money for average seafood ( or anything else ) .
the miso soup was barely average .
sub-par sushi .
no greeter so we were n't sure where to go .
the rest was dry .
it was disgusting .
she however did not offer to comp the meal .
we sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room .
not good .
the food was ok , but nothing special .
it 's a shame b/c better service would have made the experience decent .
go somewhere else for lunch , there are many better options in the area .
the food on the other hand - absolutely horrible .
so disappointed with this place !
the menu was pretty random and everything we tried was really average .
the drinks were n't anything special either .
never been before and went on a thursday night at 6pm before a show .
i 'm sure it is in the liquor license application .
not my scene whatsoever !
super bad energy in this place .
i did n't even say goodbye to the friend who had brought me there .
smoke bomb disappeared !
she knew i would hate it but just did n't want to go alone .
i was pissed .
the night was not lost .
i am not saying that people who like this place are any particular sort .
thats pretty lame for a downtown bar just because they were not packed .
extremely disappointed .
i 've been going to this bar randomly over the last _num_ years .
it 's definitely gone downhill .
there were maybe _num_ people around the bar .
but the attitude of this place could be better .
the menu was small and underwhelming .
the flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box .
obviously , if you choose to patronize this establishment , pay cash .
the guys here were borderline rude to me when i dropped my car off .
so really it was n't a terribly difficult job to be done .
i could have saved a lot of money and time and done it myself .
wo n't come again to this place ... .
do n't bother .
it was boring and flavor free .
oh , and the grocery store wine was way over priced .
food was fine , wo n't go back for fear of the server .
while here , we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini .
the blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum .
however , the rum killed any blueberry or mint flavor in the drink .
the sole basil flavor of this drink made it unappealing .
ok , i 'm in !
i figured wrong .
well hell , what was your first guess ?
i ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side .
i say `` some '' turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive !
when it did , it looked ok .
it was very disappointing .
however , i 'm mainly rating their food and service .
in fact , i could n't finish it .
we both threw down a brew nasty , paid and left .
unfortunately for olive or twist , the visit would probably be our last .
my biggest complaint is the drink prices .
it 's somewhat upscale , but it 's not the ritz .
owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal .
this bar is cramped , overpriced , and the service is unbelievably slow .
seriously , avoid this place .
very disappointed .
it was frustrating .
unfortunately , they were very disappointing .
her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm .
thankfully i just dislike tomatoes and it was n't an allergy issue .
there was also no pineapple chutney .
overall , very disappointed .
but the positives stop there .
neither one of us ate more than _num_ chips .
completely bitter and disgusting !
do n't go here for anything but the walls and music .
we both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps .
my first impression was the outdated decor .
the restaurant has carpet which i find off putting .
the food was mediocre .
visited with a party of _num_ last weekend for a friend 's birthday .
can you say awkward ?
we went back in the main door , clearly confused .
the bartender looked at us but kept pouring drinks ( rude ! )
we were seated , and had to wait awhile for service .
i was too drunk and full of pita donuts to eat my dinner .
the two bites of my pork belly sandwich were pretty alright though .
this time was not so good .
no problem , we were seated right away .
anything to acknowledge an unacceptable wait time .
we did n't get anything , and that was a little disappointing .
not a fan of the service .
it literally killed me to leave a tip .
guess the men at olive or twist only like men .
$ _num_ bill and it was n't good at all !
the customer service displayed was some of the worst i have ever seen .
the food was underwhelming at best .
no acknowledgement when we arrive .
asked to leave my card at the bar .
never came out to see how we were doing .
worst service i 've received in a while .
i would n't go if you are of flavor descent .
i asked the waitress ... did n't this come with the mango salsa topping ?
why did n't they do that in the first place .
maybe it 's nostalgia for the cigar but i thought he looked ridiculous .
there 's a reason it cost that , because it was n't very good .
the sauce was disappointing .
i would n't come here for anything .
we 'll feed these to our dogs when we get home .
avoid this tourist trap !
first time in pittsburgh , from chicago .
no one seems to know how the public transportation system works .
why do i need to request a stop on the `` t '' ?
oh , pat buses , why ca n't i quit you ?
why does n't the schedule know this ?
i was _num_ minutes early for the bus i was trying to catch .
i can understand a delay during rush hour , but this was not .
for shame !
i do n't even really know where to begin with this review .
well , it does get one from point a to point b in pittsburgh .
there 's no day pass .
i have been riding the bus for as long as i can remember .
anyway port authority to sum it up , is a hot damn mess .
one year after they cut that route after being there over _num_ years .
its only been in new york and dc for years !
getting on and off is confusing .
when to pay is confusing .
the service is n't frequent enough .
the subway system only goes to one neighborhood from downtown .
the buses smell like urine .
sucks , sucks , sucks .
on an _num_ degree day one buses heat was on full blast .
not the drivers fault .
buses are late all the time .
port authority sucks !
they have the worst transportation service ever in pittsburgh .
they also cut back bus services and lay off all these bus drivers .
pathetic !
pittsburgh is known for their worst transportation !
the bus number is _num_ .
i wish someone had informed the port authority of this .
_num_ . )
singapore had this for their buses in _num_ !
_num_ . )
some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
i waited two hours today in the freezing cold to get to work .
had to call off it was just to cold out !
considering the size of pittsburgh , the bus system here is actually pathetic .
so why not actually make a decent public transportation system ?
finally , drivers range from super friendly to scary or just rude .
one , quite literally , threw a guy off of the bus for me .
it varies bus by bus , time of day , and more .
* wasting over an hour of my time .
big league cities need big league transportation .
_num_ stars ?
what i found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating .
okay , i 'm not from pittsburgh .
nothing was dry ?
half my dish was potato .
there was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu .
nothing raw , nothing green , nothing fresh , not even as an ingredient .
_num_ fights broke out while we were there .
anyway - i wo n't be heading back anytime soon !
avis customer service says we have to wait _num_ hours .
thanks for starving us avis and making us sleep in our cars .
i rented a car with this location as the drop off point .
i signed all paper work and returned the keys .
i became very angry .
worst customer service at this place .
no grace period or understanding at all .
she was as useless as a tsa agent .
why did n't i get paid then ?
i 'm not from here , so maybe i do n't share the love .
i probably wo n't be back ever again .
i thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird .
totally not worth it , unless you just go for the fries and drinks .
unfortunately , this place is pretty dirty .
make sure no flies land on your food .
unfortunately , i learned this the hard way .
i recently ate a _num_ oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint .
that was the worst meat that i have seen since junior high school .
we would have been much better off at burger king .
worst sandwich on earth .
oh primanti 's , you always disappoint !
_num_ these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly .
_num_ the bread .
maybe we just went to the wrong primanti bros location .
gross !
many people told me to go here and i was totally disappointed !
okay on to service ... everyone seemed like they hated their job .
it was really , really , not good .
so i guess if you want an authentic pittsburgh experience then go here .
i do n't care to ever go back and will tell friends to avoid .
in philly , they 'd be out of business in a heartbeat .
a native sent me here , an apparent pittsburgh landmark .
what i got was a very dry and tasteless sandwich .
service was indifferent , at best .
my first time at primanti bros in pittsburgh , pa .
i was not impressed with my sandwich there .
i think with some mustard this might have been great .
it was dry .
after sitting there and being ignored for _num_ minutes we just left !
rude , arrogant , and just nasty .
i do n't blame it on the servers but whoever manages the place .
when i told people i was going to pittsburgh , everyone recommended primanti bros .
it was a big sandwich , but the flavour was not amazing .
i also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me .
i do n't like coleslaw .
you 'll get a sandwich with soggy fries and coleslaw on it .
the sandwich at best was mediocre .
apart from that , i do n't know why you 'd return .
2nd experience , today , equally as awful .
their fries are also soggy and gross .
the sheer size of it all was just too much too .
the concept is n't that ridiculous either .
just get fries and coleslaw and put it in your sandwich .
the only flavors were vinegar and pepper .
( did i mention they tasted like old fryer grease ? )
the sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive .
be warned that everything here comes with french fries , even the salads .
they are soggy and tasteless , maybe the worst i 've ever had .
half the sandwich falls out while your eating .
ordered a grilled chicken salad , take out .
i only go there when dragged by coworkers .
lack of flavor really hurts them in my opinion .
it really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients .
i really do n't know what the hype is about .
i was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant .
but then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me .
i immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again mia .
she just disappeared again .
i waited as long as i could but she never came back .
until then she was just missing .
i had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it .
i was really annoyed .
i no longer have to carry around my terrible , terrible secret .
to be honest this place was not that good at all .
the sandwiches , although unique , were not that good .
it was all french fries and very little meat .
what a disappointment .
maybe my expectations were just too high , i do n't know .
previous reviews have said it well : lackluster , tasteless food .
boring sandwich .
so , why such a low score ?
the service was terrible .
have n't you been to any restaurants , like , ever ?
sit back down and i 'll take your order . ''
it was unbelievable .
utterly , totally unbelievable .
the chicken was like tasteless rubber .
i ca n't for the life of me figure out why all the hype .
i was warned by others that this is mainly where tourists eat .
but i 'm a tourist here , and wanted to try it .
it was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries .
the thick white bread was dry and boring ; too crusty .
he gave me big time attitude and commented that i took it apart .
and that , sir , is why you got a $ _num_ tip !
they left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich !
nope , wo n't be back .
disappointed , big time .
the sandwich was soggy , bland , and just all-around not good .
i did n't get sick from it , so that 's a bonus .
go to meat & potatoes instead , and order a sandwich there .
tonight was my second attempt here .
not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff .
no more tries here .
to compare this place to the famous sandwich places is nyc is a joke .
if you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them , go for it .
but no good sandwich needs nonsense like that .
i was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed !
everything was bland , nothing had seasoning , not even basic salt .
however , they only have two waitresses outside for about _num_ tables .
it took _num_ minutes to get our drink order .
our waitress was very rude and did n't make me feel welcomed at all .
it 's not fair for the customers or for the servers .
_num_ stars for history , _num_ for food quality and flavor .
in total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food .
if you do n't have the time just go next door to the subway .
i stand by my decision : pass .
she came back _num_ minutes later , with the beers and took our order .
when we did finally get our food , it was ice cold .
i had very little meat in mine , and more coleslaw that anything else .
why the hell are you in such a hurry '' .
had such high hopes for this place on our visit to pittsburgh .
worst service ever .
can i give this place zero stars ?
gross . )
this place was trashy , dirty and probably not even up to code .
my first visit was to the one in south hills .
waited _num_ mins for _num_ sandwiches .
the coleslaw is gross and i 'm a fan of coleslaw .
this time i got the grilled chicken salad .
the chicken was tasteless and rubbery .
it , however , did n't work for me .
it 's not much of a cheesesteak .
i ca n't hold it against them though .
i chose poorly .
this sandwich shop lacks all of those things .
highly disappointing .
bland .
service good prices cheap but food very bland and pre made .
coleslaw was a lot better with the hot sauce i smothered on it .
the beer makes everything tastes better so order at least two beers before eating .
i 'm not a big foodie but i like my food taste better .
the market square location has the most horrible service i 've ever experienced .
horrible !
will never return to any location !
service was bad .
highly disappointing philly cheesesteak !
first , we were disappointed by how many places were closed on a sunday .
the only reason i 'm giving it two stars is because of the bread .
i asked if she had pbr , and she replied she did n't know .
ok then , how about i just have a diet pop .
before she ran off , we ordered our meals .
and then just stood there waiting to write my order down .
it was just strange .
of course , the order came out quickly , and wrong .
getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server .
my aunt picked up lunch , and left the tip .
outside of the bread i ca n't say it was memorable in any way .
basically , this place is like dr. pepper soda .
people are crazy about it but that thing tastes extremely ridiculous .
ok , i get it , your busy .
so , after all was said and done , my sandwich was just ok .
nothing to write home about .
sorry , i guess it 's just not my thing .
i do n't care for primanti brothers .
the sandwiches are n't bad , they just are n't great .
the main ingredients just seem to be lacking in quality .
my other issue is their restaurants are all filthy .
i 've been to _num_ different primanti locations and each one just seems greasy .
place sucks .
this was after waiting 20+ minutes at the register with cash in hand .
rude !
not worth it .
very bad foods .
very bad service .
they were rude .
i do not recommend this place .
that being said , this place was not good .
firstly , the food had no flavor .
that has nothing to do with our party size .
the only seasoning available are salt , pepper , hot sauce , & ketchup .
big disappointment .
neither i nor my husband understood the hype about this place .
we 'd probably never go back .
i do n't understand the hype with this place .
the sandwiches they serve are gross !
super dry and no good flavor other than the cole slaw .
the only thing this place has going for it is the local hype .
the coleslaw lacked flavor and the bun was simple white bread .
the fries on the sandwich added no additional flavor .
hate slaw but tried it with slaw anyway .
nothing special .
way too much coleslaw .
def split it and get ice cream for dessert somewhere else .
only good part was an outdoor concert going on just outside of it !
for both sandwiches , the bread used was extremely bland and borderline stale .
the veggies were about average , not fresh , but did n't taste gross .
essentially , the entire sandwich was inedible and i settled for five guys instead .
nothing special .
so , i got a turkey sandwich with the coleslaw and fries on it .
too many fries on the sandwich .
oh , and like _num_ slices of meat and a slice of cheese .
i 've been here three times and it 's been inconsistent .
they really overload the sandwiches with coleslaw and french fries .
i end up picking half of my sandwich apart .
it looked pretty awful like a hard , dry , high school cafeteria lunch .
i would n't recommend this place .
we ordered the `` pitt burger '' and boy was it disappointing .
the burger is dry and lacks flavor .
the bread was the worst part .
ugh .
trust the reviews , it 's not worth the wait or the money !
it 's just bad .
the servers are polite , but extremely inattentive .
came here after a _num_ 1/2 drive expecting the best sandwich i ever had .
the sandwich sucked ; no flavor , no excitement .
and the beer menu was mediocre , at best .
on the other hand , the fried pickles were great .
and the wait staff were awesome .
also , parking was shit .
my advice : locals must not know shit from their asshole .
this place really did suck .
i sent it back - showed the gal my burned pastrami sandwich .
she has an attitude and reluctantly made me a new one in _num_ minutes .
for the most part they were rude and inattentive .
it is not .
disgusting .
guests always mention they ca n't wait to try go here .
i dread it at this point .
wrong .
never going back .
for one , the service was terrible .
the food sucks .
you will leave smelling like cooking oil .
and their beer selection sucks .
horrible customer service !
but the dipping sauce for the tots were on point .
there is very little meat on the sandwich .
service is n't that great either .
for all the hype this was very disappointing .
skip it .
not a fan of the french bread .
wo n't be coming back after this visit .
i am visiting from california and was very disappointed with the service and food .
it was all bread and coleslaw .
the waiter was not nice at all !
each time , i ask myself , `` why am i going back ? ''
it was grilled chicken , french fries , a little cheese on chopped lettuce .
the bread is _num_ % of the meal .
not so much .
my friend got an italian sub that was ok .
skip this place - there are other decent cheap eats downtown .
upon entering you are immediately greeted by pure chaos .
the service is horrible ... friendly but horrible .
i ordered two double cheeseburgers and waited over twenty minutes for them .
this mcdonalds is straight crap .
the staff does n't seem to care .
he make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly .
they sit on tables and often just sit at your table .
he make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly .
they sit on the tables and often just sit at your table .
i think this should be more like _num_ stars .
the preparation instructions seem questionable ( microwave in a plastic bag ?
being from la , i was disappointed with the tacos .
unfortunately , it was not as good as i hoped .
the cashier had no idea what we were asking for .
... can you call back later , i 'm really busy . ''
finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile .
oh wait though .
it 's horrible .
i wo n't be going back .
i have been there _num_ times .
food ok but service ... ... horrible !
he got our salsa order wrong so needless to say , we left .
this makes me sad to write this .
did they bite off more than they can chew ?
completely unacceptable and disgusting to sell such expired food to your customers .
check the expiration dates on all purchase from here !
she over charged us for her very badly made drinks .
the food and drinks are very over priced for what it is .
omg what a nightmare .
the second time , though , was tonight , valentine 's day .
it was n't very crowded , so we were seated right away .
they were n't dressed how i would have expected them to be .
but , our waitress was helpful , and our food came out pretty quickly .
it was n't a memorable meal or experience .
the bleu cheese dressing , though , tasted pretty good .
i 'm not a fan of that .
the seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible .
the staff is rude .
the prices are too high for the quality .
just all around disappointing .
i wo n't be back .
went to this place for lunch last saturday , party of five .
and the waitress did n't return until after we were done eating .
horrible service and horrible food !
it took _num_ minutes for our waitress to even come to our table !
the crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and i had to switch meals .
i could n't even taste the crab !
the fish and chips looked great but it did n't taste like anything !
a complete waste of $ _num_ .
my husband and i went tonight for dinner .
bad mistake .
worst meal we 've ever had .
busy , slow and awful .
the air conditioning was non existent , which is a hangover nightmare .
i 'm not a beer drinking novice .
bland .
i should n't have to ask for napkins at the point of need .
no tip , never coming back .
service gets _num_ stars and food gets _num_ stars .
overall , this place gets a _num_ stars .
then again , we were in pittsburgh , so it 's a given .
the waitress was slow getting around to us .
i wo n't be back .
first , all of the food was extremely overpriced .
i could n't have tried to make food this poor .
extremely slow service !
i would give this restaurant _num_ stars if i could .
i do n't even know where to begin .
service was horrible .
the lunch took _num_ hours .
it was not .
it was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top .
and a side salad at almost $ _num_ .
not worth it .
just awful .
what a complete disaster .
we were both craving seafood , and had never been here before .
needless to say , we were unable to take advantage of any specials .
anyway , we sip our disappointing drinks and decide to order an appetizer .
we did not feel any of these things .
it 's not like they were busy .
in short , i do not believe we will be dining here again .
this place was terrible .
the seafood tasted old .
the bathrooms were gross and probably never clean .
i am just hoping that i do n't get food poisoning later tonight .
why on earth did i go back to this restaurant ?
clearly , i must not love myself or something .
want to pay too much money for fish that smells like a sewer ?
there were _num_ of us on a beautiful sunday afternoon .
with _num_ waitresses .
the fish was hot and crispy .
but the clams casino were inedible .
the clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping .
the crab cakes were also bad .
it took _num_ minutes to get someone to take the bill .
poor service .
took _num_ minutes before someone came to take our drink order .
took another _num_ minutes to get the drinks .
the waitress then proceeded to say the mussels were ready .
not worth wasting your time .
went on a wednesday night , not crowded at all .
service was just awful .
no he did n't !
the fish sandwich arrived nearly _num_ minutes before the rest of our meals .
i will give them hell . ''
service was terrible .
brick oven pizza cold ... .
asked to have it reheated , still came back cold .
steak was way over cooked .
was not busy but waitress was hard to find .
would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone .
friends warned me not to eat here .
this was just awful , start to finish .
and a generally miserable experience .
and this was an early lunch with very few customers around .
are you kidding me ?
that 's not a lobster roll !
the `` lobster '' was sparse , tough , and flavorless .
at $ _num_ each this falls clearly into the ripoff category .
and trying to get our check ?
ridiculous .
i wo n't be back .
we did n't realize most of the restaurants are closed on mondays .
tried thin man , closed .
however , the last few times we have been there it has been terrible .
while the food remains okay , the service leaves something to be desired .
the waitress was rude and less than helpful .
our _num_ drink and lunch took over two hours to complete .
diner _num_ - ordered the lobster roll sandwich .
nothing special - have no idea why people would rave about this .
bland and awful .
diner _num_ - steamed clams .
diner _num_ - ordered the salad with the lobster roll , hold the bread .
why the need to put lobster in a dye ?
sent the mussels back .
rest rooms are dirty , and smell of urine .
you have been warned ... stay away !
if _num_ stars were possible i 'd give em .
just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off .
look on his face - totally rude and completely inept .
i was hard put to give _num_ % tip to be honest .
you will only get frustrated with the slow as hell service .
suggestions , hmm not entirely sure since nothing i ate here impressed me much .
_num_ were supposed to be in an order but they only delivered _num_ .
_num_ more minutes for drinks , and to order .
i 've tried and tried to give this place a chance .
the oysters were absolutely disgusting .
they were not fresh , or cleaned very well .
as always , the service was terrible .
never again will i spend money in this place .
service was great , however , the food was mediocre .
they had to be cooked prior to us ordering , or even getting there .
the burger was just eh .
overall , this joint was not that great .
waited for about _num_ minutes at the entrance .
no hostess coming up .
she did not apologize and says that it will take another _num_ minutes .
i just did n't feel satisfied at the end of my meal .
and it was cold - did n't even take my winter coat off .
so , needless to say , not the best experience .
overall , my experience was okay .
we got the scallop appetizer and it was to die for !
i will _num_ % go back for that !
that being said , it was downhill from there .
i 'll go back for the scallops , but would n't recommend anything else .
the beer choices and the casual menu was right up my alley .
unfortunately the food was not .
ca n't recommend the place .
waited 15-20 minutes for service and it is not busy .
waitress did apologize for cup but it was too late - chose to leave .
i noticed the beer sampler and thought i would give it a try .
they were cold but did not taste fresh .
the lobster inside was a small amount , cold and tough .
the slaw was reasonably good and cold .
i would be hard pressed to ever return .
stopped in on the fourth of july for evening cocktail and small meal .
from horrible service to terrible seafood ... would never return .
um , no ... it was more like garbage sewer sauce .
mussels were freezing cold .
how can a seafood place serve terrible seafood ?
this place is terrible .
spend your money somewhere else .
she brought our soups , which luckily had spoons in the huge bowls .
poor excuse for seafood !
unless you sit at the bar , the service is poor .
is n't even that great at the bar .
the place is gross !
i liked the bar .
overcooked and dry , dry , dry .
this lobster was dry and chewy .
lots of it , though i guess that accounts for the high price .
then the other day , we went back and i tried pizza .
the toppings were terrible ( pepperoni , sausage .
super disappointed in this place .
when the food arrived it was mediocre at best .
will not be coming back to this place unless i 'm dragged .
they may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a saturday night .
i think one star is being highly generous for this restaurant .
it was by far the worst experience at a restaurant i have had .
it was disgusting .
this was such an absolutely horribly disappointment of a restaurant .
do n't waste your time here , especially if you have kids .
oh and less than stellar fries , with a cup of cole slaw .
ugh if i could give this place _num_ stars i would .
what a nightmare .
after almost an hour of waiting , i still had no pizza .
you do not deserve this job and should be fired .
after reading reviews i was afraid of what kind of service we would encounter .
i would n't order food here , again .
this place is less than mediocre .
visited on a friday night and it was pretty crowded .
the clam chowder was just ok .
like , i was shocked by how much it tasted like nothing .
not worth the bucks .
life is too short for less than mediocre food .
absolutely a waste of time and money .
service is just terrible .
the food was terrible and way overpriced .
just awful .
the restaurant was too busy .
the bathrooms were atrocious .
it 's never horrible .
has n't made me sick , again .
i do n't eat seafood often so i would n't know .
service was okay not the greatest but not the worst either .
kitchen staff was slow in execution especially for not having a big crowd .
huge portion .
despite the size , the flavor was lacking as well as texture .
they used real garlic and it was served with it - minced .
looks better than it tastes .
there were _num_ of us and they brought out three .
my salad came out shortly after the appetizer sliders .
no soup for me apparently .
no bueno .
unless your are here for a beer , forget about it .
i tried one but could not taste the chicken but otherwise it tasted okay .
the person next to me ordered the beer battered giant fish sandwich .
no fish .
terrible experience here .
the mussels were barely seasoned and were hardly edible .
it was awful .
i got the lobster roll and was really disappointed .
did n't even offer a food menu .
paid for the lousy $ _num_ beer and got up .
there was only _num_ bartender working so the service was a little slow .
the food was bland at best .
alas , the bisque tasted like wheat paste .
on wet cardboard .
maybe i just ate the box ?
else , you will find better value and experience elsewhere .
i did n't think it could get any worse ... .
i witnessed more apologies to customers that day than i ever have .
it was n't even crowded .
it took _num_ minutes just to get our waters .
i had to spit the oyster out in a napkin .
the food , however , was disappointing .
it looked like it went bad and they cooked it anyway .
then i tasted it and knew it went bad and they cooked it anyway .
that , for me , ruined my whole meal .
no amount of butter and salt could save that corn .
my bf got the steak with battered shrimp .
waited to be seated for _num_ minutes , no one greeted us .
she walked up the stairs and ignored us .
needless to say , we will not be returning to this place .
never going back , letting our bank handle this one .
super slow , cold fries , freezer burned carrots , rubbery lobster claws .
wait , ceasar salad was ok !
no stars !
great shrimp cocktail but i wish i had my fish sandwich across the street .
my overall opinion is that the service was terrible and the food was overpriced .
anyone who had french fries said they were cold .
the mashed potatoes were lukewarm at best , and the vegetables were cold .
the only good thing about the experience was the beer selection .
for a $ _num_ meal each , not great .
i will remember to never return while i 'm in pittsburgh .
horrible atmosphere for the food on the menu in parts .
they charge like $ _num_ for this , which is a complete ripoff .
here on vacation and the waitress seemed annoyed we wanted food .
lobster roll was dry and salty .
if anyone had asked , i would have shared these comments .
lack of chicken and brown , mushy lettuce .
i see why this place is hurting for business .
terribly salty `` lobster roll '' on greasy bread .
needless to say we wo n't be back !
literally disgusting .
their food is gross and i 've seen nice running around in there .
no host and the bartender asked if we were going to eat .
ordered the lobster mac n cheese as an appetizer .
for dinner i ordered the pan seared scallops with red mashed potatoes .
extremely disappointed in this dish .
then , my brother got the prosciutto and arugula pizza .
it was nasty .
my chicken sandwhich was also made with rubber chicken .
horrible experience .
this is one of the worst experiences i have had at a restaurant .
they squeezed _num_ people into _num_ small tables given the restaurant was fairly empty .
the only way to describe the food is disgusting .
-i split the giant beer battered fish sandwich .
the fries were cold , and the sandwich and fries were very greasy .
between two of them they finished one piece and could n't tolerate anymore .
i tried a bite of it .
the waiter was terrible .
overall the food , service , and atmosphere deserve _num_ star .
i would not recommend them .
so why just a `` _num_ star '' rating ?
terrible service !
told _num_ minute wait for food .
sarcastic bartender and place half empty .
the steamed mussels arrived in a grey broth that looked like sewage water .
the crab cakes were cold and overly salty .
what a horrible experience .
thankfully , our later stops were much better .
my appetizer was cajun shrimp , which was way over seasoned .
i could n't even see the shrimp underneath the thick crust of cajun seasoning .
the mashed potatoes were great , everyone agreed on that .
the bathrooms were disgusting .
this is probably the worst review of a restaurant i 've ever written .
but this place was just awful .
terrible tuxedo rentals !
when i picked it up , it did not fit !
poor excuse for a gentleman 's store .
oh , and its very very expensive !
the staff at the downtown location tend to be rude .
dark roasted , bitter , etc .
rude .
he did n't make a comment but i thought , rude .
what i received was a whole milk latte .
she said `` fine '' ( rude ) .
but this is n't what i ordered .
and am not a fan of the _num_ % .
rude .
so very rude .
that was not a real latte .
it 's sometimes tough to get waited on even with nobody in the store .
she clearly has no clue , pride or care in coffee making .
unfortunately , mike & tony 's closes by 6pm .
cheap gyro combo = cheap tasting meal .
the fries were cooked to perfection , but lacked flavor .
the gyro itself was mediocre .
the slice of chocolate cake , while a descent size , was rather tasteless .
she apparently had no time to take a wet cloth the the tables .
i kind of felt bad for her .
the food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do in a pinch .
they are open late hours , so sometimes that can be handy .
it sits in the warmer cases , and looks `` crusty '' .
owners should know how they are being represented at the front register .
it is cheap food , and you get what you pay for .
it was very cold inside the restaurant .
my husbands pork was a small portion .
it was very inexpensive and i understand why .
wo n't go back or recommend it .
my dad and i walked in around _num_ pm on a friday night .
the dining room was about half full .
people just seemed to be standing around this whole place for no reason .
sucks .
why post a closing time if it is n't honored ?
this is an odd little cvs .
this was my first time trying brown bag deli too .
this was one of the most disgusting restaurants ive ever been in .
so , i decided to sit outside as i had already ordered my food .
then , i go to check out , my dinner was $ _num_ .
i hated it !
followed with an arrogant face !
please ... .
the only restaurant that gave me so rude , unprofessional answer ever !
oh my god ... .
should i really tell him how much he deserved ?
this place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising .
overall the food was hit or miss .
the most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat .
my companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable .
all patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross .
even homemade wine and honey soaked cake wo n't bring me back again .
this place was really gross .
the olives were even disgusting -- how do you mess up olives ?
the bill was way too high .
if you really hate someone , you should take them to this restaurant .
dirty , unclean , my friend and i went to lunch here .
this place is below par in just about every way .
i asked for my check and barely ate anything .
do n't bother with this place !
i wo n't go back .
the hummus is a little bland .
my issue was the price , $ _num_ .
my boyfriend and i decided to split the platter , which was horrible .
mostly negative , but hey i was hungry and gave it a shot .
i declined that after reading is was mediocre at best .
* the owner failed to mention the pita bread was extra .
it tasted worse than it looked ( if that was possible ) .
tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy .
another mistake was sitting outside when they are trying to bring people in .
i ordered the chicken kabob .
very bland and it actually tasted baked not grilled .
i did n't finish it .
the spinach pie was ok .
bland again and very chewy .
it did n't taste fresh , almost frozen at one point and microwaved .
the cheese pie was pretty bad .
i will not go again .
better than nothing , i suppose .
none of our food was good .
a struggling business is always sad to see .
but with all of the strange behavior , attempts to scam us , etc .
too slow service .
was waiting for my check about _num_ minutes .
annoying waiter .
i 'm not sure if this is working hard or just desperate .
_num_ ) the owner is pushy .
_num_ ) the portions are small !
_num_ ) the lemonade is _num_ % ice !
_num_ ) $ _num_ tip even though the owner is the server .
stay away and never look back .
i had spaghetti and meatballs and a caesar salad .
normally i hate salads in places like this .
the lettuce tastes old and rubbery ... not in this case .
find something ... anything else ... it is going to disappoint .
service is lacking and food is mediocre .
no thanks .
disappointed .
however , neither were great .
in fact the room we sat in had approximately _num_ open tables .
just my _num_ cents .
do n't get me wrong ... the food is not atrocious .
but it certainly is sub-par .
the service was mediocre .
it has gone downhill badly .
the last visit last night was the third strike and sw is out !
very poor service and food .
the drinks were all ice and refills were not timely .
this is the strip district after all with many stores for crying out loud .
the food was very poor .
my wild mushroom and chicken was not warm but tasted okay .
we will not be going back .
why anyone would willing go here to eat is beyond me .
anyway , i ordered the wild mushroom pasta with chicken .
the sauce was really disgusting .
thank you for your feedback regarding your visit to spaghetti warehouse .
your comments have been sent to our general manager , christopher beers .
their service is a hot mess !
just getting our drinks out was confusing .
for our dinner , we were given a salad , entree , & tiramisu .
it did n't taste fresh at all .
there was a list of _num_ or so entrees we could choose from .
i unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever .
i could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar .
the tiramisu also was gross .
i 've never been to one & was really excited .
seriously though , their food is so bad .
it tasted like it came out of a walmart freezer on clearance .
wo n't be coming back anytime soon .
came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building .
the food left much the be desired .
the service was the worst i 've ever encountered .
needless to say we did not return to redeem it .
overall , i 've got no complaints about the food .
but there was no one there .
after waiting way too long to even be acknowledged , my order was taken .
skip to the second time .
while this is happening , several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks .
i was a little salty with her , i 'll admit .
this place is dead , but they just do n't know it yet .
a couple tables taken , but no sign of staff in the bar .
not a table in the bar area had been cleaned in that period .
and the restaurant is empty !
maybe _num_ % full !
they made us wait simply because they ca n't staff correctly .
no wonder it is _num_ % empty but still makes people wait .
as my review makes clear , i ca n't compare the food .
and i am certainly not a fan of the olive garden .
you ca n't screw up pasta -- it would be very hard .
our waiter ( vincent ) had _num_ tables .
i gave him my drink order and then he asked for our dinner order .
why would you not just get our drinks ?
not terrible .
true , this is n't capital grill , nor was i expecting 5-star service .
i did n't even know what fine dining was until college .
the worst service ever .
it was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress .
the food was mediocre at best .
total waste of money .
i went here after seeing a musical and it was terrible .
my sister sent hers back because it was cold .
the place is old and outdated , and the restrooms were horrible .
save your money and make spaghetti at home !
they are understaffed , incompetent , and slow .
it was like getting waited on by 1st job people .
it 's tacky too hot .
they play pop music and it 's supposed to be an italian place .
very very slow service and no authenticity in the meals .
im from california and was excited to experience this restaurant .
unfortunately what i got tasted like a canned sauce with minced onions .
as much as i hate olive garden ... i would preferred that .
ca n't give this place anything lower than _num_ star .
all our food was the thrown together in the same pan .
not worth the $ _num_ .
worst place ever .
we talked to the manager i 'm assuming which did n't really care .
said hopefully we come back because service is n't usually this bad .
we hopped this was a one off and not typical .
avoid this place at all costs !
nothing i had tasted good .
just skip it .
nothing special .
did n't seem handmade or anything like that .
service was incredibly slow .
i probably would n't go back .
the wedding soup was the worst i have ever had .
the meat balls had absolute no taste , kind of like cardboard .
the spaghetti tasted no different than boxed pasta .
our garlic bread came out literally black .
i ca n't even believe somebody would serve that .
we will not be back .
every dish had several things wrong with it .
even the bread was stale .
mushy spaghetti drenched in the worst sauce i ever had .
i wish it were possible to give this place _num_ stars .
they 're wrong .
the pasta is consistently overcooked .
the service is not only poor , but the staff are rude .
i will not visit this restaurant again .
i 'm not italian , but i cook way better than this myself .
there was a little bit of a wait which is expected on saturday night .
my son 's macaroni and cheese was salty and cold .
this place is a disaster .
the service is really spotty too .
pros : never a dull moment .
the whole experience can be both amusing and depressing at the same time .
baked ziti average .
dont like too soft pasta , al dente preferred .
i was not impressed at all .
he seemed to be in a bad mood and made us feel uncomfortable .
however , food wise , it was just ok and a bit disappointing .
i of course had filet , and i was just so underwhelmed with it .
the flavor was meh and the black truffle butter was surprisingly boring .
they are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation .
gone is the famous gm bill .
changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks .
the meat was n't special .
the deserts were ok but the creme brulee was bland in the extreme .
service was ok but occasionally inattentive .
my biggest gripe , though , would be the overcooked scallops .
wow , not so much .
very strange experience .
the food was bland .
nothing to write home about .
i dined at morton 's last night jan _num_ , _num_ .
the food was not good .
i feel i paid $ _num_ for a $ _num_ meal .
service was great but it sure was n't morton 's quality ?
what the hell is going on people ?
omg , the cheese cake ( at $ _num_ ) was very dry .
$ _num_ is not working for me .
his side of mac and cheese was laughable .
i 'd have to say i was pretty disappointed with my overall experience .
the sides left much to be desired .
i ordered steamed broccoli and he ordered mashed potatoes .
we had to send the potatoes back because they were cold .
do n't believe i will be returning here unless it 's free !
terrible value but the steaks were good .
$ _num_ caesar salad with tasteless dressing that probably came out of a bottle .
$ _num_ side dishes .
probably the worst value around .
we had dinner tonight and were so disappointed .
the food was bland at best .
the only thing that was efficient was the valet service .
the service is here so incredibly inconsistent .
the way you are treated is sub par .
the entire staff was rude .
the downtown office has ruined america 's best for me forever .
the customer service here is horrible .
i feel like everything i say is wrong .
very poor customer service at this location .
$ _num_ down the drain .
it was a horrible experience .
if only they could train their employees better .
there was mildew on the floors of my bathroom and bathtub .
the washer and dryer was old .
the sofa looked old and was not comfortable .
i did not use the comforter and one of the layers .
there is also a _num_ inch ?
they did not offer me a chance to pay for it .
i never used the sauna , so i can not comment on that .
this is rather expensive as well .
this is not a bad place to live .
the shop is n't that great anyway .
such a shame .
it was made of wood .
the women at the front of the line had been waiting ten minutes .
finally , someone wandered in from the back and rang up our items .
i guess all customers are n't equal .
the high prices and poor treatment do n't add up .
i put up with the rude employees and dirty store because of this .
here is where my mistake happened .
sad , very , very sad .
not worth your money .
needless to say , this completely ruined my meal .
it tasted like milk and no coffee .
i was exceptionally disappointed .
managed very poorly .
6am is too early for her .
out of _num_ reviews , i 've written only _num_ _num_ star reviews .
that 's _num_ % .
if you hate the public , you should n't work with them .
she never even looked at me .
rude .
not hearing me , she goes , `` what was that ? ''
was she having a bad day ?
i dont know , i do n't care .
managed very poorly .
6am is too early for her . ''
seriously lady , you 're not a morning person .
my latte was n't bad ... was n't anything special either .
would n't come here again .
will probably never go here again because the person servicing me was rude .
they simply did n't care .
worst brazilian wax i have ever gotten .
she also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary .
eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $ _num_ .
do not go here for waxing !
sorry that i did n't feel like waiting for three other customers .
i will likely not give them my business again .
my order was $ _num_ .
i got nowhere until i asked that a count of the register receipts .
that was not acceptable to me .
there is a bitter taste in my mouth about lotus grocery .
this is not giant eagle !
never shop at this asian grocery since many more open .
owner and employee alike no manners and nasty .
good store - rude owners and employees .
not anymore though .
not because of the food but the attitude of those cashiers .
so gross !
staff definitely are really rude .
try not to come here unless it 's for emergency .
the food you need to be careful , because sometimes they are expired .
also , parking is a big problem .
finally on tuesday , i came out to the shop at _num_ am sharp .
i tried on the dress and it was super short .
it was about _num_ inches off the ground !
other than that , it needed hemmed and taken out just a touch .
long story short - she took the dress in ... significantly ... by mistake .
there were no apologies for the mistakes .
we sat down and jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed .
i arrived and was disappointed to not see the arrangement i ordered .
imagine my frustration .
unsatisfied customer !
for $ _num_ plus delivery ?
will take my business elsewhere in the future .
no big deal , i would have been happy to help out .
i stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go .
when i received my order i immediately opened it to take a bite .
my biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste .
that 's right , my burrito had no flavor .
it was all beans and guacamole .
food was only just ok and service was even worse .
i 'm so disappointed in my experience at the carnegie library !
_num_ $ later , i tossed it and walked out , miserable .
this place is not _num_ stars .
i 'm too annoyed right now to make any funny comments .
it 's ... just ... not that good .
it all snapped into place for me one day recently .
that pissed me right off .
second , the rolls here are sloppy .
the beef was not the right color and was basically bland .
i would n't call this place authentic korean bbq .
just do n't expect fantastic korean bbq .
nice big restaurant , just lacking in overall experience .
this place was mediocre at best .
not impressed .
gross !
sad thing is , i 've been here a couple times .
so on to the sushi , oh yeah , it 's gross too !
the thing is the fish does not taste fresh at all !
but i 'd suggest you not !
you can not pay me money to eat here again .
they can not even cook edamame , it was undercooked and cold .
texture and temperature of the fish scared me .
save yourself pain and throw your money out the window .
first of all , foods were n't impressive .
they are too pricy as well .
their foods are not that tasteful .
in addition , one server working there was really rude and had bad attitude .
i do n't understand why he is working there .
he was so rude and ruined our friday night .
it 's really frustrating .
i wo n't come back this unpleasant and pricy restaurant never again .
absolutely the worst sushi my husband and i have ever had .
it was gross !
you could n't pay me to go back to this place !
upon arrival , the place is nearly empty .
however , it was also past lukewarm to the point of being cool .
the most disappointing part is the sushi itself .
the food that was delivered to us was simply inedible .
it had a huge hair in it , all wound around the crab .
totally disgusting .
they actually screwed up a green salad .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
total waste .
we will be calling again today to get our money back .
sushi is not overpriced although the rolls could be made better .
there are much better sushi choices available .
i was there on a monday , so i just tried the sushi .
do n't bother with the sushi , ca n't speak to the korean bbq .
long story short : i ordered delivery .
vegetable roll was good , but not exceptional .
fried rice was ... just not what i expected , not exceptional either .
still , would not recommend .
pricey and does n't live up to it at all .
was the worst i have ever had .
will not go back .
i am sorry to say that this place still stinks .
that should have tipped me off .
i ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu .
my food was terrible .
avoid this place at all costs !
fine , i had a sushi craving and could n't care less .
i ordered my spicy tuna and salmon rolls , both came within _num_ minutes .
but for the sushi - forget it .
that is simply lazy .
this place was awful .
her meal was so hot she could n't eat it .
mine was just disappointing .
the only thing i found good was the plain rice .
i also thought it was extremely over priced .
great service but the sashimi was bad .
never been here before .
disappointed in that .
what reason would a restaurant serve water in a plastic cup is beyond me .
i had a pretty negative experience for my first trip to sushi kim .
korean barbecue requires either the patron or the server to cook at the table .
i will give sushi kim another chance because i know others rave about it .
the wait staff -- not too pleasant !
man ... really bad from start to finish .
service is slow and horrible .
sushi is not flavorful at all .
the rice was some of the worst i have ever had .
i was definitely not wowed by the sushi here .
not bad but i have better in the strip .
so disappointed .
sadly , they just are n't .
could n't keep my eyes open !
another waste of time , wait until people my age get old .
i can guarantee you we will not be wasting our time in this theater .
avoid this crap hole at all costs .
the food is not that great .
my husband thought that the crab was bland and overcooked .
the menu is blah and the food is also .
awful service , overpriced food .
do n't waste your money !
on arrival , waitress seemed lost .
the wait staff is incompetent and the food is grossly overpriced with zero flavor .
i just paid the bill and we left and went to eat n park .
when we showed up , it was like i 'd never called .
the service here sucks .
it just sucks here .
it 's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer .
however , the service is seriously lacking .
the service has always been very slow .
go in summer or no point in going .
i 've went for _num_ years now waiting for it to become something good .
it 's not going to happen .
i ca n't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment .
the bartender gave my sandwich by mistake to another customer .
i waited .
ordered , is not .
the bill .
a little pricy for food but not too bad .
this is a poorly run business that could be turned into something great .
it was my anniversary tonight , a tuesday .
i was so excited to get all you can eat crab legs !
very disappointing .
however , the food and service is sub par .
not impressed .
_num_ minutes later half of our party needed to leave .
they went home hungry and very unhappy .
it 's not even summer yet .
i stopped by here this past thursday night with three others for dinner .
that was definitely not the case though .
mediocre at best .
buffalo shrimp $ _num_ you get _num_ , barely enough to share .
shrimp tacos were ok just on a basic bed of slaw for $ _num_ .
no drafts or specials on a friday when we got there at _num_ .
the river view from the deck was nice , but the smokers were not .
rode my bike out to meet my old man .
but seriously , there are still restaurants that allow smoking ?
_num_ stars .
my husband ordered the margarita pizza & i ordered the shrimp tacos with rice .
hubby did n't mind his , my was terrible ... horrendous .
rode my bike out to meet my old man .
but seriously , there are still restaurants that allow smoking ?
_num_ stars .
service was slow and inattentive all night .
described as having crab , lobster and shrimp .
seared ahi tuna sandwich - _num_ people in our group got this .
fish tacos - _num_ people in our party got these .
long story short , we wo n't be back .
overpriced beer and overpriced , bad food .
battered and fried .
we did n't care for the atmosphere and did n't actually eat anything .
in the running for one of the worst restaurants in pittsburgh .
looks great from the outside but everything else about it is terrible .
they turned no wait off and said they tried to call me .
the food sucked .
peel and eat shrimp were dry and tough , not fresh .
ordered crab cakes , they were dry and the crab tasted old as well .
will not be returning .
probably wo n't be back .
i 'd give this store negative stars if there was an option .
no one at the counter even acknowledged my arrival .
it looked rather like a barber shop .
the staff did n't look very professional either .
and after her comments , i 'm so glad that i decided to leave .
very poor service and atmosphere .
thumbs down !
at that point i would 've just taken a plain biscuit !
a complete lack of work ethic , it 's disgusting .
you do n't have to have people in the kitchen who act like that .
rotten food and over charging customer .
the crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from rotten crab .
a lunch over charged and wasted .
did n't go so well .
they then brought out two manicotti dinners which were fine .
who serves a drink without ice ?
we had no silverware , had to request it repeatedly .
our entrees , dessert and coffee all came out at different times .
the prime rib was fatty and cold .
the atmosphere is also drab and just depressing .
avoid !
the food is pretty bad for an italian restaurant .
i ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce .
the homemade bread was very sorry ... .
not worth the price .
the decor is very plain .
the food was underwhelming and pricey .
it 's just not that good .
the food could have come from a buffet and been better .
this place is just a flat out joke .
had no clue what i was talking about .
food was overpriced and less than average .
she had zero personality .
you 're probably thinking $ _num_ or $ _num_ , right ?
wrong !
now i really wish we would have .
i would have been furious if i paid $ _num_ for tasteless pasta .
never again will i go there .
the only reason i gave it a _num_ is because the steak was good .
otherwise , it would have been a _num_ or _num_ .
i 'm a guy , i 've got a short haircut .
nothing fancy -- short on the sides and back , an inch on top .
the top was n't even and was kind of a mess .
i wo n't be back .
fairly average italian food other than the meatballs .
too many good italian places in pittsburgh to choose here .
interior could use an update .
beer selection below average and nothing special happening with speciality drinks .
the food quality does n't match the place at all .
i had the chicken flatbread and the chicken was more like subway chicken !
zero stars .
the only good thing this restaurant has going for it , is their bar !
worst .
they said that each vegetable would be $ _num_ each .
with that said , i opted out of the calzone .
i ordered a steak and cheese hoagie and it arrived in a burnt bun .
i may try the pizza but other reviews noted it was pricy .
no refills , no checks on the food , nothing .
they do n't make whole pies and slice them up for individual slice orders .
the salon is so dirty we left before i let them cut me hair .
save your money , this place does n't deserve to be named ruth chris .
if this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen .
sadly , however , they did not .
that does not make me chop liver .
however , my father and i shared the porterhouse for two .
for $ _num_ , i would have expected a much better piece of meat .
there were some pieces which could not be cut by my knife .
in addition , the presentation was poor .
i could have done better at home .
i 'm really torn by this review .
unfortunately , the worst part of my meal were the steaks .
next time i 'll try morton 's or capital grille .
but one is supposed to come here for steak .
extremely disappointing and appalling .
we were seated and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable .
the corn chowder was ok but not very hot .
the steaks came and were both overcooked .
again , the food was mediocre but the staff was extremely friendly .
this was the only place where nothing tasted like any of them .
fail on all levels .
had to send steak back twice before i just said to hell with it .
horrible .
plus they have the worst presentation ever !
they clearly used too much oil and did not let the meat rest .
never going back !
how far we have fallen .
our bill was over $ _num_ .
tip was $ _num_ .
what a disappointment .
this is the `` service '' industry and you missed the mark tonight .
poor , slow service .
steak was over cooked and the plate was hot but not `` sizzling '' .
i said no , not yet which was probably a mistake .
our wine was not delivered until after our steaks arrived .
we will never return to a ruth 's chris steakhouse .
he gave them a quick polish and took $ _num_ off the price .
he had my money and had no more use for me .
this place is horrible .
you can get better service elsewhere for cheaper .
i brought my boots here to get fixed .
i wo n't be going here again .
no accessible stalls in restrooms .
not handicapped accessible .
wrong .
after i ordered , the waiter came back twice .
once to tell me that they could n't do the veggies .
oh , with _num_ pitiful shrimp on top .
there was the powder parmesan on the table which i added myself .
oh , but wait until i got my bill !
the shrimp were $ _num_ a piece .
what a rip off and so much for my budget .
we had a big group but my bill did n't have the tip added .
get me out of here !
i get that -- but the place was empty .
the place is empty .
it was such a nightmare .
i did n't know hamburgers were traditional italian fare .
the prices here can be ridiculous .
i mean , empty .
no one else in the same dining room .
i took the olive oil off the table next to ours .
so , i 've tried this place _num_ times and that was enough .
not worth the attitude of the staff .
it was just meh .
the chicken was n't very well seasoned and the sauce was overpowered by lemon .
all i could taste was citrus .
i also had a few bites of the chicken marsala .
i was really disappointed with this visit .
we probably wo n't be back any time soon .
negatives : the lighting , the decor and the smoking .
glad we went , but we wo n't go back .
so i left .
the selection here is stellar , but the prices are ridiculously high .
even whole foods is less expensive .
the service is most often rude .
the gelato counter was disappointing .
is n't that the same as `` not made fresh in pittsburgh ? ''
the truffles had two salted , one of which was milk chocolate .
they were so salty that the chocolate flavor did not come through .
however that is not what pittsburgh is about .
this is just my experience .
no thanks , much better candy shops around the city .
rude !
any way i could n't figure out what their problem was .
thank you for your horrible customer service i will never be back.
there 's nothing about this specific location that is bad .
inside is just average quality , equally average priced produce .
cheap , everyone seems to say that .
but i was n't feeling it here .
did n't even get a `` thanks '' with my change .
so not worth the walk that we took to get here .
we were greeted very warmly by one of the ice cream technicians .
the parlor looked nothing like the pictures on this website .
the technician was telling us how it was closed and had just reopened .
the character of the place was great but could use a little tlc .
the menu was very small and hard to read and understand .
the ice cream technician could only take one order at a time .
i ordered mine , chocolate , and cried vanilla .
she did n't listen at all .
i figured palace like this would have made their own strawberry topping .
_num_ sundaes were $ _num_ .
literally they kept their heads down and refused to make eye contact .
too bad .
no breaking of the ice .
this place is terrible !
ugh .
skip it !
really disappointed !
she left her other co-worker to handle the entire crowd .
we had the same experience when we walked in .
however i agree with the previous reviews that the staff are killing it .
just kind of awkward , but no big deal .
a regular ice cream cone was $ _num_ .
tasty , but not real butter pecan .
i gave her a call and she did n't pick up .
at this point i really had to use the restroom .
i waited until _num_ and knocked normally so that it would be heard .
i 'd give it zero stars if i could .
worst customer service !
but these corporate suits refused .
so - they 've lost a customer - a platinum customer .
a little goodwill would have cost them nothing .
truly pathetic .
when i checked in , the front desk staff was missing .
when i checked out , the front desk staff was missing .
the pillows were appalling and there was no complimentary breakfast and no refrigerator .
what a disgrace to the marriott name .
ok , but they do not go out of their way to help !
finally they allowed me to put down cash .
literally worst service i 've ever received at a hotel .
do not stay here .
you will be disappointed .
the manager nowhere to be seen .
no upgrades .
not personal at all strictly business .
the better restaurant is the little cafe across the street owned by same owner .
to get a cab walk to the westin across the street .
no hello on entering .
not friendly .
not a _num_ star .
really a _num_ star .
nothing to recommend .
do n't walk away .
not even the shuttle goes anywhere useful .
linda b august _num_ will never stay again !
i had a bad impression of this hotel before i even entered .
eventually , i had to get my project manager to resolve this issue .
do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 am .
that young lady obliged with no hesitation - i was very grateful .
the desk ) until i 've given the room the all clear .
i could n't have been happier !
no bueno and no thank you !
my second room : same line , 3rd floor , also accessible .
that 's unacceptable .
shower shoes , i never leave home without them !
i reserved a king room and got stuck in a room with two queens .
i will not be staying at this location again .
they apologized which i appreciate , but it does n't fix anything .
i ca n't wait to check out .
her corned beef was brown and bad .
the real reason for the single star was the cole slaw .
it was off .
yuck i have avoided this subway like the plague .
i literally walk past this subway _num_ times a week .
the attitude of the workers here is just pitiful .
what a wreck .
rude customer service .
my gripe here is that i ended up with scratches on my wheels .
waiting _num_ minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable .
it was not crowded , but the waiter was almost useless .
plus i was served teriyaki fajitas .
overall it was just ok food served by an incompetent waiter .
for me the food was terrible .
i would n't even have cooked this way for an enemy .
they are in terrible shape .
i could n't believe it !
well , this place manages to be worse than it .
the place is rather run down .
the buffet was really terrible .
it just was n't a great environment .
_num_ stars .
soups were borderline offensive .
there probably wo n't be a wait !
bad !
worst chinese food in pittsburgh !
this is the worst chinese food i 've had .
and pittsburgh has some pretty bad chinese places .
the golden palace buffet is bad , but at least edible .
it was late at night near closing , only thing i could find open .
went to _num_ tavern for lunch a few weeks back .
second i was with a party of _num_ that all ordered salads .
overcooked and cold .
the salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap .
the place was empty .
it 's the same thing but _num_ more dollars .
they did have other types of dogs but they were more expensive .
it was bad in every way it could be bad .
frozen , greasy , tasteless , heavy on bland batter and light on fish .
so why do they get _num_ stars instead of just _num_ ?
but each time i come away disappointed , even more than last time .
every time , the hotdogs ( and brats ) are harder than a rock .
wo n't be eating there again .
i do n't understand why this place think 's it has famous corned beef .
i can only believe it 's because there are no other deli 's downtown .
the corned beef is nothing great and their side dishes are nothing special .
not worth the trip .
i do n't think sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich .
meat was dry under seasoned and luke warm .
the bread was just sliced supermarket bread .
rules made by men .
when the food finally came it was bad .
the prices are cheap , but it 's not worth it .
the food itself was not too bad .
not my favorite .
my friend 's greek salad however was very tasty .
a place i would go back to but not regularly .
the food was terrible !
we quickly found out why .
i would not recommend this place for food .
this is a very small irish pub .
the bar area felt cramped and made me uncomfortable .
are you gon na eat that ?
if not , um , why would we want to pay for it ?
terrible .
they did n't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy .
the soda was flat .
possible the worst restaurant i was ever in .
worst experience at a restaurant ever .
i do n't need anything fancy but this was pathetic .
why did n't we just leave then .
if i could rate this a zero , i would .
food was not awful , but just barely average .
worst restaurant ever .
finally got seated and waited _num_ minutes for waters and then ate mediocre food .
wo n't be back .
the steak was rough and bad .
i will never be back .
i have better food in m own .
definitely has the local irish bar feel to it .
mine was not very cold and his pour was light .
$ _num_ credit card minimum .
no bathrooms .
it really feels like a total lack of effort , honesty and professionalism .
this represents a real problem for the city .
this place was horrible .
the walls were dirty , nasty and dingy .
it smelled awful inside .
it was quite crowded .
and i just did not like my surroundings .
not a good way to sell the city ... horrible !
this continued for the total of _num_ hours .
there is no wifi and only two outlets .
it would have probably been better to take the mega bus .
not good at all .
thus station needs more amenities and a makeover to compete with the dc one !
the `` chicken '' is dark , fatty , and inedible .
do n't miss the _num_ pound tub of msg as you walk in .
you should skip this place for sure .
the place was more of a hole in the wall then i can appreciate .
cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality .
the food was gross and i usually would n't say that about a place .
never going back .
it 's not worth it .
they were very quick ( food ordered and delivered in under _num_ minutes ) .
the noodles were very bland and almost chewy .
my boyfriend 's general tso 's was less than subpar .
the egg roll 's did n't even have shrimp in them .
this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever had .
it was horrible .
the fried rice did n't have any vegetable in it and was so bland .
the egg roll wasnt even cooked and the cabbage was awful .
i called to complain and they hung up on me .
do n't waste your time , order from somewhere else .
worst chinese i 've had in pittsburgh .
i spend _num_ dollars on soggy food that lacked flavor .
cheap food but my chicken was burnt .
my co-worker 's chicken was n't cooked right .
not gon na order from here again .
we wasted $ _num_ on spoiled food .
do not use this dry cleaner .
there are ash trays and packs of cigarettes lying around .
they lost my clothes and charged me for stuff i never sent .
ehh ... it 's not all that .
watch the dried bulk stuff - it 's old and stale .
i found little bugs crawling around the seeds and nuts in my little bags .
bought the store 's speciality sausages - bland and tasted of spoiled meat .
cold cuts were good though pricey .
highly questionable hygiene for a food store !
disgusting .
i will not go back until they clean up the place .
that was not the first time .
i have a idea , get rid of those cashiers , fire them !
i will not go back until they are gone .
a simple yes or no would have been nice .
in a very rude voice .
needless to say i walked away .
obviously she hates her job , then get another one !
every january i buy _num_ months worth of cheese for my family members .
i proceeded to say , '' are you laughing at me ? ''
altogether , spent $ _num_ and left with a great disappointment !
extremely poor service .
this is the last time i try this unclean and rude establishment .
breeze and the cat was tested and was negative .
there was no internet at the time .
i would not bring a spider there .
if i could give this place _num_ starts i would .
it was just average , nothing special .
this is no mike and tony 's or big greek gyro in market square .
i wo n't be back .
the workers are not greek chefs and are very condescending .
the gyro sandwich for $ _num_ was ok at best .
they threw some tomatoes on it .
the fries for $ _num_ were undercooked .
we are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup .
they charge about $ _num_ for a drink with no free refills .
tables were not very clean .
disappointing experience after almost a year since the last time i was here .
ingredients were n't fresh and the gyro was heavy on the spices .
ordered a gyro and the meat was cold .
not acceptable .
i really do n't see the hype .
i 've only eaten here once before .
i 've included this very depressing looking `` steak hoagie '' .
the food was terrible & the cooks need to get it together .
just order from one of the two sites i listed above .
not one employee even said hello !
i walked out !
, the service was fine , but the food was totally forgettable .
i remember the waiters attitude more then some of the food .
the menu is n't particularly veg friendly , but it 's not too bad .
lidia 's does high-end traditional italian without being too pretentious or too predictable .
i really wanted to like this place , but i really did n't .
long story short , we passed on dessert .
i wo n't go back .
lidia 's is an upscale olive garden with slightly better wine list .
the biggest problem ?
everything is bland .
they have a salt problem .
the lamb chops were awful .
lamb tasted like the grill and not at all like lamb .
the tomato was hard as rock .
just bad .
bread is awful .
just in the way it is laid out and with the choices .
but the worse is the pasta trio .
the concept is just so olive garden .
i just have to wonder why lidia would create a menu like this .
it just does n't match her books or shows at all .
it does nothing to support the brand of lidia .
unless she is really trying to take over the olive garden market .
their menu does n't include really any .
maybe those light fixtures would have tasted better than the lasagna ?
the service was not very good .
we left overall feeling disappointed in the service and the quality of the food .
not so much .
i had a bite of a chocolate torte , and was very impressed .
all things told , though , i would spend my money elsewhere .
it was not spicy .
it was overcooked , like rubber , and served on plain white beans .
i wo n't go back .
most of his seafood was also overcooked and tasteless .
i was very disappointed with my meal here .
and was really disappointed .
too bad the food was n't good .
the beet salad was underwhelming .
my other dining companion had the osso bucco which was dry and stringy .
another disappointment .
and thus my rating of meh .
which is a huge shame .
this place had horrible service .
i was horrible .
we were eating here often , but it got boring quickly .
soooo disappointing !
i watch lidia on tv and have a lot of her recipes .
then , i ate here .
are these the same people running this restaurant ?
do n't you care about your reputation and good name ?
guess not .
also , the service was not that good .
too bad .
one word ; gross .
this is not italian food - it 's pittsburgh italian food .
the wine list is lacking .
in short , avoid this place !
the main courses themselves were a disaster .
and the manicotti was watery and flavorless .
i ordered the chicken marsala ( waitress 's favorite ) and it was disgusting .
lidia 's was a major disappointment for me .
decor and service were just fine , no issues there .
i was disappointed in the food !
i get better shrimp pasta at macaroni grill !
i 'm not sure why people like this place so much .
the service was friendly but the food was very poor .
i would not entertain having an event for any more than _num_ people .
what an embarrassment .
the lasagne i ordered was flavorless as well .
for salad , they only served `` caesar salad '' .
overall , let me say that the restaurant is becoming dated .
colors and decor seem boring and out of style .
the service was horrible .
from hostess crew to the bar to the waitress , it was bad .
rude .
did i mention the service was bad ?
the bar staff was n't concerned with us and were n't friendly at all .
then it took another _num_ to order .
then _num_ mins to get our food !
however , seconds never came .
waitress did n't even know until i told her politely .
however she charged the $ _num_ pasta trio ( which comes with desert ) .
now i had a $ _num_ salad and $ _num_ pasta trio .
i was expecting $ _num_ + $ _num_ salad upgrade .
ugh .
is n't the rule `` customer is always right '' ?
finally , we felt like the whole restaurant clientele has declined .
avoid !
what a disappointment .
we were so looking forward to the food but our experience was awful .
there was no background music .
the waiter was young and inexperienced .
would not recommend it .
this spot would n't have lasted a year in nyc .
i ate here when it opened , a and again _num_ years later .
nothing has changed .
for starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads .
the entrees were dull and lacked seasoning .
it 's tough to find anything good here .
the menu offerings were spotty .
gnocchi and duck ragu was what i ordered .
i was very disappointed .
ate at this resturant while on a business trip .
our food was just average , nothing special .
the service was absolutely horrible .
our waitress carrie was extremely rude and had a really bad attitude .
i would probably not come back .
lidia 's was one of our favorite italian restaurant in the city .
first , our waitress was not well informed of the offerings that evening .
she had to check with kitchen several times to answer our questions .
second , our food was served just barley warm .
third , the food was lacking in proper seasoning and without any taste .
i guess i expected fabulous -- but everything was just good , nothing spectacular .
we will not be back .
nothing to talk about .
the service was sub-par on a friday night .
for my entree , i tried the lasagna recommended by the waiter .
took my friends from out of town to lidia last night , very disappointed .
i could n't understand why people raving about it too much .
over charge and terrible food .
terrible will never go back .
calamari was not fresh .
pasta trio had the worst sauce i have ever tasted .
caesar salad was drowning in tart dressing .
pasta trio - _num_ out of the _num_ was passable .
good groupon deal but terrible food - will not be back .
horrible .
i do n't remember it being this bad .
pasta trio was bizarre .
only passable pasta was the pear & ricotta ravioli .
waitress walked away two times while opening our bottle of wine .
it was downhill from there .
lamb chops and shrimp pasta were just ok.
( $ _num_ + $ _num_ ) .
the salads came out and the plates were a little sloppy in appearance .
for the main course , i selected the gnocchi and grilled sausage .
the sausage was made in-house and was very flavorful .
very unappetizing and i was unable to continue eating .
the pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was n't too sweet .
even the server commented on the lack of a sauce .
no meat in any of the _num_ pastas .
not very tasty .
not same price .
i had the pasta trio .
none of the pastas had any flavor .
the caesar salad was fine , but not inspiring .
the three pastas were very , very basic .
the only thing that saved the evening from disaster were our server and busser .
i think lidia & grandma would be appalled !
so i was appalled by a lousy not fresh dirty salad !
i pushed it away ugh !
do n't be fooled !
it came w duck ragu that was ice cold !
try their calamari over angel hair yum !
lidia should be embarrassed .
grilled octopus : where 's the octopus ?
waitress was nice but it 's obvious that this place is run poorly .
staff training is badly needed .
what a huge disappointment .
bottom line : horrid service , mediocre food .
no wine glasses or anything to make the table look pretty .
our server was nice but rushed .
there was absolutely no care or thought put into this salad .
my date 's bruschetta appetizer was bland .
i was presented with ... an empty plate .
which i really did n't since they were all mediocre with little flavor .
in the meantime , date was unimpressed with the chicken .
if possible , the service got worse after we talked to him .
and when the dessert came it was ice cold and solid as a rock .
horrible service and food was bland .
lidia should spend more time in her restaurants to see first hand .
the waiter said she only comes to town twice a year .
your brand is being damaged because your staff does n't seem to care .
very disappointed .
most likely will not return .
more disappointing than the service was the food , which was really underwhelming .
granted , the calamari and shrimp that were there were cooked perfectly .
risotto , while one of my favorites , is n't pasta .
it has been nothing but bad service .
i give a _num_ rating only because of the service .
there are fruit flies hovering around our table too .
the pasta with chicken was about the best from the trio .
it 's an ayce trio .
it 's now 8:30 and still not even close to dessert .
i 'm sure the ending does n't get much better .
we were ... disappointed .
our main dishes were equally mediocre .
the wild boar ravioli tasted fine , but the presentation was seriously lacking .
the duck breast was under done .
so disappointing ... .
he never approached our table , but he walked past us several times .
we continued to wait another _num_ minutes then decided to leave .
lidia should be ashamed that this is being run this way .
really wanted to like it here , but am never going back .
for a professional chef 's restaurant the `` pasta '' was mediocre .
fake italian at its finest .
unless olive garden is closed , do n't go here .
unfortunately yelp asked to provide more details on review .
the information for this restaurant needs to be updated !
last week my husband and i visited pittsburgh for a rock concert .
it was a very disappointing meal .
i ordered the pasta trio , and my husband ordered the risotto .
not exciting .
it was pasta , after all , one small serving of each .
i had dessert , which was _num_ flavors of gelato .
sorry to say , restaurant is riding on its former reputation .
the bartender does n't belong in the business .
rude to patron and to his own colleagues .
a turn off .
first off , it is desperately in need of some updates .
and service is piss poor and understaffed .
_num_ big screen tvs .
well sports rock failed on all accounts .
i was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual tvs on each table .
plus , beer was _num_ !
prices too high for strip district beer .
upstairs looks like it 's a club at night .
it is a white pizza with minimal ingredients except for the lamb skewers .
standard so-so pittsburgh pizza .
if they did n't , that would be fine we 'd call someplace else .
should be _num_ minutes '' .
_num_ minutes later the delivery guy calls and says he 's on his way .
_num_ minutes later he calls again and asks where we are .
when we finally got the pizza , it was not hot .
better luck next time .
after ordering from here my credit card number was stolen .
ordered two personal size pizzas , spicy fries , fried zucchini & onion rings .
tastes plain & over cooked .
i do n't think i 'm being harsh .
is sad because the pizza is great but the service is horrible !
delivery : horrible experience .
we waited over _num_ hours for the food to be delivered .
she promptly explained that the internet was down .
and , apparently , delivery .
it was all kind of meh to me .
food is terrible so is customer service .
there are better restaurants in pittsburgh .
this is piss poor excuse for a turkish restaurant .
this was more than _num_ hours after i had placed the order .
as soon as i hung up the phone , the food was delivered .
i did not receive the free cheesy bread and the drink order was incorrect .
i would be careful ordering food here .
the service was very poor .
delivery was fine but the food was terrible .
disappointed !
unacceptable .
but it was seriously bad .
but i could n't eat it .
are you kidding me ?
these hoagies are the most pathetic hoagies i 've ever seen or eaten !
you should be embarrassed and ashamed to even be selling these !
horrible !
we checked in , put our stuff in our room , and left .
later on , we realized that there was no soap anywhere in the bathroom .
you 're paying like $ _num_ a night for no soap .
about _num_ minutes later someone came with soap .
it was a super rude way of dealing with that situation .
the next morning we tried to leave and it was nearly impossible .
the whole experience was absolutely ridiculous .
but would it kill you to spend a little to upgrade your rooms ?
upon entering it smelled of sewage and was very dark .
it did seem a little unwelcoming and a little dated .
i was then transferred to housekeeping where i was constantly sent to a voicemail .
it is unfortunate because that blanket has been in the family for _num_ years .
i was tired , packed bags , and waiting to get to the airport .
i did n't hear back .
they said yes , and i just confirmed it had not been .
by far , the worst hotel staff experience i have ever had .
i would never stay in this hotel again .
the cleanliness of the bathrooms is less than desirable .
the pittsburgh auto show was held at the david l. convention center .
we lucked out and go on the shuttle over without waiting in the cold .
it was terrible waiting in line , but it moved quickly .
it was $ _num_ a piece for my wife and i to get in .
children _num_ and under are free .
$ _num_ for _num_ items is crazy !
domestic beers were $ _num_ .
i mean thats absurd to charge these prices !
the auto show was a disappointment .
that was frustrating !
it was pretty busy and there were people everywhere .
it was annoying fighting the crowds to look at the certain cars .
all in all , it was a disappointment this year .
we might not go every year , but maybe every other year .
the check-in desk was super slow during my stay there .
still , i think there are newer hotels that provide the same .
we got this hotel room via hotwire at a great price .
parking at the hotel is expensive .
my biggest complaint is that our shower was n't clean .
the coffee shop attached to the hotel is just ok .
or it had just spilled and they did n't want to waste it .
however , the customer service lacks excellence and the wifi is completely unreliable .
completely worthless wifi .
we have stayed in westin hotels all over the country .
but this place is downright disgusting .
no fitted sheets on the beds ?
the tv movies did n't work ?
the place is just dirty .
two seconds later , they come to want to clean ?
i would n't step foot in that hot tub ever again .
unless you want to catch a disease .
so gross .
the pool is strictly a lap pool .
and the women 's locker room was nasty .
looked like it had n't been cleaned in a month .
the only plus was the shuttle service and driver .
do n't stay here , save your money .
however , i had the absolute worst hotel experience at the pittsburgh westin .
the terrible experience happened before i even arrived .
i ordered the turkey blt with lemon aioli and arugula salad .
really poor service and way overpriced .
the rooms are not worth the money .
the wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good .
i would not revisit the westin convention center .
had to have my sheets changed when i got to my room .
worst elevator system i 've ever come across .
rude front desk staff .
talk about a nasty look and attitude .
i was sooooo disappointed with this hotel .
the ac barely works .
_num_ stars .
but maybe they 're not even trying !
again this is pittsburgh not philly , dc , or ny .
breakfast options in the immediate area are almost nonexistent .
the coffee maker is disgusting and smells .
i gave the management a heads up , and it was not fixed .
disappointing at every turn .
this hotel does not live up to the westin standards i 'm used too .
the hallways smell as do the rooms and they are not clean at all .
the beer is cheap .
horrible , go to long john silver 's .
i hear oyster bar and think delicious raw oysters not deep fried crap .
i should know better than to have high expectations .
the two jumbo fried shrimp were ok.
nothing but breading .
ugh .
both the waitress and the bartender were extremely rude .
i was n't impressed with my clam chowder .
however , they have several cooked selections .
i should have known then that it would be a bad experience .
waitress wiped off table and pushed crumbs into my lap .
styrofoam plates and plastic forks .
it really is just a bar with bad bar food .
cash only is really customer friendly as well .
do n't understand how anyone could give this place a favorable rating .
i 've had the fried oysters before , and they were pretty good .
this lunch kinda sucked .
a native all my life and never been , finally went last summer .
why it 's locked i do n't know .
totally gross !
sadly this one did n't do that for me .
this restaurant is horrible .
the waitress was rude and tried to rush us .
the only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind .
i found this restaurant online and in my hotel room magazine .
sadly we were disappointed with our meal .
we were in an area with a server , but the service was terrible .
i 've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash .
are u kidding me ?
i am disappointed .
the food was ok but it 's not memorable .
imitation crab & lots of filling .
so i do n't need to tell you how nasty that was .
my house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor .
so i was like dang !
my return is questionable .
first thing they said to us was , we only accept cash .
guess what , no fresh oysters .
the beer was cold and that is the only reason they got one star .
i was embarrassed because he was my guest and it was my idea .
if a cold beer is all you want , go for it .
this place is a pittsburgh legend u got ta stop in .
the oysters are also old , as in not fresh .
just checked it out for the first time .
kind of disappointed but it was five dollars for the shrimp basket i got .
the shrimp does n't have any flavor and just tastes like grease .
i was the girl who came in tonight , alone , around 8pm !
_num_ minutes later , nothing .
eventually i had enough and left , which they still probably did n't notice .
avoid at all costs !
i do not recommend this restaurant .
the fish sandwich is bland on a generic bun .
the soup was nothing to write home about .
the fries were generic .
long wait time for initial service and drink refills .
just not what i had in mind .
i wo n't be going back .
when the oysters came out , they did n't even look like oysters .
they were very flat ... thinner than your typical frozen chicken nugget .
not much oyster taste , just the taste of the breading .
this was some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .
this does n't generally happen to me .
i could n't eat anymore .
avoid .
this place is awful .
they screwed up my order and refused to fix it .
its really too bad , they are super close to my apartment .
i 'm upset and offended .
but the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude .
had the gyro and added feta .
bottle of coke had icy slush in it .
update - went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best .
possibly the worst pizza i have ever eaten .
this would n't even qualify as pizza in north jersey .
zero stars .
female manager on duty asked for $ _num_ in exchange for a pizza .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the eastern european girl at the register is awful .
she should probably get fired .
the pizza at this place is o.k .
last night i decided to give it another try and got crappy mozzarella sticks .
the meat in the steak sandwich was like dog food .
it gets packed .
i 'd never had the food before .
so gross .
i usually get the steak salad which used to be good .
the last _num_ times getting it , i have had issues .
i gave the bartender $ _num_ and only received $ _num_ back .
i can not eat this .
sticky floors , bad smell , just general lack of housekeeping .
not sure why people like it so much .
if we had been drinking we would n't care .
maybe they had a bad day .
one other person tried it and would not eat it .
the fish n chips were not good .
the fries were soggy and soft , fish mediocre .
very disappointed .
will not go eat there again !
there 's a reason why this place has no reviews .
it 's never open ... not even at 6:30 pm on a thursday .
i guess i was supposed to know that it was closed .
needless to say , i probably wo n't be back .
this is a very odd restaurant .
i was here once and probably wo n't be back .
you can definitely get better vietnamese elsewhere in the city .
she could n't believe that i said that .
i feel like she treated me like a criminal .
the service as mentioned was poor .
this place does decent thai food , but is nothing special .
this was the single worst thai meal i have ever had in my life .
this proved to have been a massive error in judgement on all our parts .
the first thing i ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup .
gross .
we will not be back .
was just rude .
the wonton soup was horrible .
when i walked in the place was empty .
first thing i noticed is the place was an absolute sauna .
she shrugged and did not seem interested .
i ordered the lemon grass soup with shrimp and the papaya salad .
i would not order this again .
water glass was refilled promptly the one time it was starting to look empty .
the pad thai was bland and generic , and tasted almost gummy .
and i would n't have minded if the food had been amazing .
but sadly , it was n't .
we were seated immediately because it was n't too crowded ( bad sign ) .
did they think they could get away with it and we would n't notice ?
but then i got my chicken lemongrass soup .
it was so tiny and there was hardly any chicken in it .
waiter was awful and food ( pad thai ) was not much better .
this is by far the worst thai restaurant i 've ever been to .
the servers are rude and slow , and the food is awful .
just had the panang tofu for lunch , and was crazy underwhelmed .
this trip was bad , even for the price .
there was no sorry , we 're working on it ... etc .
no explanation at all was given .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
terrible terrible customer service .
poor service , awful attitudes and sub-par food .
thai tea was no bueno .
i 'll probably not be back .
there was just one table of _num_ seated and eating when i arrived .
and , a table of _num_ leaving and all paying separately .
all that said , the huge table of _num_ had left .
but , no such luck .
the food came out quickly enough .
but it was quite underwhelming .
i settled with the thai fried rice with beef .
there was a ton of thai basil in the dish which was quite overwhelming .
i chose the hot and sour soup .
the soup was neither hot in temperature or spice but it certainly was sour .
however , last night 's dinner was just plain bad .
it was also virtually tasteless .
the food is bland , bland bland .
the inside of the resturant is cramped and poorly maintained .
i decided to play it safe and ordered the broccoli in garlic sauce .
do n't waste your time or money .
rude service , and pizza was subpar .
na ... wo n't be back !
random pizza toppings on lettuce ) this time around .
just awful .
it really is pure torture sometimes .
ugh .
but no biggie - we agree to split into different tables .
ridiculous , especially if they were expecting us to be there .
an extra large pizza was so small it barely fed my wife and i .
also the pizza was bad .
way overpriced and service was n't great .
i only gave them _num_ stars because the pizza itself was pretty good .
i ca n't imagine anyone liking this super bland cardboard !
i just do n't get how anyone could like it ?
no taste at all .
both had no flavor and the crust was chewy and lousy .
no sauce much and cheap cheese .
somewhat generic , but the espresso gets the job done .
it was quite small though .
average pittsburgh pizza and fried stuff pile , nothing special though .
fried items arrive a little on the cold and soggy side .
you know , standard italian hoagie .
i substituted steamed rice for the fried rice .
it was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice .
i could barely pick the shrimp out because the sauce was that gross .
hope i have better luck next time !
i just ate half of a cockroach .
gross .
the food was unremarkable .
every time i have been to cafe sam i have been very disappointed .
avoid this place .
got ta say , i 'm not a fan of this place .
confusing , and a pain .
but over the years it has gone down hill .
i wo n't go back .
my girlfriend had a similarly bland meal .
down the street is a better option - wish they were open for lunch .
under no circumstances would i eat here again .
but oh , how the standards have fallen !
looking back , i am glad it happened that way .
items seem overcooked or undercooked .
this was probably the worst plain cake donut i 've ever had .
it was dry , not at all crispy , and had no flavor .
i could n't even finish it .
i did n't find it to be anything special .
i am positive this bakery used to be better ... something has changed there .
it should have been a clue when they were soggy .
after my most recent experience , however , i will never be coming back .
she refused , and again tried to place the blame on me .
and sure enough , cue tuesday -- no call .
she failed to follow-up when she promised .
did i mention the cake was dry ?
i ordered a long john which looked pretty good .
unfortunately it was n't .
i ate maybe a bite or two before offering it to a coworker .
so many great bakeries in pittsburgh so i would not go back .
she showed me two options and i chose one .
it was also very dry .
they said they had an appointment to taste wedding cakes .
it all comes down to the crust -- i threw it out .
i had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce .
but no .
mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix ?
all i could taste was the overwhelming chemical , fake garlic flavor .
i mean thin like salad dressing , runny , thin .
this stuff tasted like really cheap , bad , ranch dressing .
while we are talking about the meat - why use this garbage ?
i am paying almost _num_ bucks for this sub .
well , this too was a massive disappointment .
yes , bland .
bad sauce with flavorless cheese .
yes , more for the garbage .
we ended up throwing out about _num_ % of what we paid for .
they just lost a loyal customer ... never again .
ordered _num_ cuts to eat in and _num_ and a hoagie to go ... .
they get _num_ star because less was not an option .
so i ordered _num_ for myself and my gf .
i get there and the total is over $ _num_ !
two and a half dollars more is not a little .
wrong again !
swimming i tell you swimming in grease !
and that its all the owners fault about the price .
poor food poor excuses and apparently poor ownership .
the crust was not like usual and to much sauce .
i used to love this place , but the service is horrible now .
if you want something delivered you have to wait about _num_ hours .
our food is always wrong .
will not be coming back .
bad service !
it was all i could do not to make a scene .
fuck that i do n't need to be disrespected like that .
they use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza .
also , the toppings were not greatly blended , just rather sprinkled .
did n't even enjoy the pizza crust .
avoid at all costs .
reviews but they let me down .
the barber could not even cut a straight fade .
i ordered here after the many good reviews but was quite disappointed .
the pizza was n't terrible but it certainly was n't good in my opinion .
zero flavor and the mushrooms were canned .
i am disappointed .
so it was no discount at all .
i can not review the food .
i did not get a chance to eat there .
all the white people get to eat , we do not ?
the woman who answered the phone said yes to both so i rushed over .
assuming this was due to the discount , i did n't complain .
receive my check to find out it was all full price .
she admitted it was she who answered yet refused to accommodate her mistake .
i do n't normally feel compelled to complain but that is ridiculous .
a subpar meal and subpar service in addition to false marketing .
completely ridiculous .
terrible .
this was flat , one note .
yep , this place is terrible .
_num_ star average ?
update : _num_ hours later and still feel sick from this meal .
ugh .
mediocre at best .
the flavor in the tiki masala was so bland .
worst delivery service .
they both looked old and one of them smelled old .
both of these dishes were extremely unappealing as well .
i sadly had to throw most of it away .
i did n't even know you could go wrong with chicken marsala !
i can easily say this is the worst indian food i have ever eaten .
maybe i went on a bad day but the food was pretty darn terrible .
but the noodles are a disgrace .
no way , dudes .
go down the street and get some tastier food at tram 's kitchen .
i 'm not joking about the water .
pho broth takes like nine hours to make .
in fact i was quite disappointed .
based on all the other reviews , probably safe to stick to pho .
if you have an emergency , go to the vca castle shannon animal hospital .
for everything else , try the cat clinic .
i asked about late hours but the latest appointment is at _num_ pm .
i start work at _num_ am .
i do n't need to receive attitude from a receptionist .
clearly , they do n't need my business .
i felt like i spent $ _num_ for absolutely nothing .
i think i 'll be going elsewhere next time .
it was a mess .
an expensive mess .
i stop in every week for it .
last week , i got a large and went back for more .
but , lately it 's been hit or miss .
it is all watered down and gross .
if your not a chain smoker , opt for takeout .
the bar reeks of smoke and the bar table feels sticky .
the only good thing is that the drinks are cheap .
but i really would n't recommend going there .
he obviously did n't care at all .
i called restaurant.com for a refund , and told them what he said .
i did n't get a chance to try any food and i never will .
this place is terrible .
tandoori chicken does n't taste like one etc .
decor is tasteless and old .
carpet looks really dirty .
i 'm definitely not coming back .
seem nice but the food is not that good .
no flavor .
we also had a masala and that too was not great .
this was not nearly as good .
very disappointing .
went there with friends for the first time and felt quite disappointed .
food was dry and the sauces were watery .
i do n't know why all the hype on this place .
trust me , you 'll be glad you did .
sadly , i was disappointed .
the karaoke host was just lame .
and he had a cd setup -- seriously , cds , in _num_ .
it was just really lackluster in my opinion .
the karaoke had a very limited selection .
wo n't be going back .
i do n't understand why people love this place .
the bar food is typical .
if you want no frills beer and bar food , they are no frills .
the place smells awful and the workers are grumpy .
no thanks .
there are other italian grocery stores close by .
i rushed to tan today after work .
atmosphere was bad .
i 'm weird like that .
it 's just generic stuff .
like i said , olive garden , only local .
so i would n't go back .
it 's not my kind of food , or place .
the other day someone asked me ... where 's your favourite vietnamese food ?
i do n't even care about the decor or seating etc .
it looked a mess .
honestly , it looked like someone had already starting eating this .
but as i ate , i was even more disappointed .
they hardly put any fresh vegetables in it , and the vermicelli is overcooked .
the spring rolls were completely soggy .
i do n't think their menu is limited though , it seemed fairly typical .
my boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl .
however , my dish was nothing to brag about .
it did n't taste bad by any means , but not restaurant quality .
my boyfriend 's dinner was a real disappointment , however .
it almost looked like boiled ground beef .
i do n't understand this either .
the rolls were extremely bland and chewy .
the sauce that was served with it did n't do much to save it .
the beef pho was sub par .
also : $ _num_ for pho does not make for hole-in-the-wall pricing .
for starters , the portion of the pho is extremely skimpy !
seriously , would it kill you to add more rice noodles ?
let me tell you , this place is a big let down .
i do n't know why people are giving it such rave reviews .
the portions are tiny , and the pho broth leaves you unsatisfied .
it lacks the true flavor that pho broth should have .
i quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in _num_ bites .
it took forever for the food to arrive , it was a big bowl .
so highly disappointed with my pho experience .
the restaurant setting is very typical of a vietnamese restaurant .
the menu is small with very limited choices .
then we had _num_ different kind of pho for our main entree .
there was also excessive msg in the soup dishes .
the food is cheap .
this is something that tram 's has gotten badly wrong every time i visited .
personally , i do n't see what is so special about it .
they 're big , but again nothing special .
at tram 's , the pho bowl is small .
the taste is reminiscent of pho but is n't quite right .
this was n't it .
it was dark and crowded ( and a little bit dingy ) .
bad service , bland food .
do n't believe the hype .
i think i chose wrong .
ordered the pho and it was mediocre and forgettable .
another sour note , they dropped off some spring rolls at our table .
later on , we saw them on our bill .
they were overpriced , and not worth it .
tram 's kitchen in my opinion is not really worth it .
the food was mediocre and full of msg .
the pho was nothing special and place was small and looks dirty .
my total bill does n't reflect the price of the dishes i ordered .
my bill came out to be higher than what 's listed on the menu .
the service was okay , they were really nice and never rude .
the portions were really small .
i gave this place two tries and was disappointed both times .
either way , i do n't understand the hype surrounding this place .
the color of the dish was as bland as the taste .
as for the atmosphere , not a big deal for me .
if that 's not enough to stop you , read on .
bland and disappointing , the pho most of all .
the dish was dry and lacked flavor .
as it were , i was n't impressed .
on top of that , my meatballs were quite dry , even in soup .
the service , was not the best .
very disappointed !
pho is ok , not bad .
this is the worst .
i will never try it again .
maybe i 'm spoiled with good vietnamese food but this was terrible .
also questionable tofu in the vegetarian spring rolls .
i 'm vietnamese , worse viet food ever !
maybe i just did n't order the right dish .
i ordered the beef vermicelli bowl , one egg roll , one spring roll .
my husband and i stayed in pittsburgh for weeks and wanted to have pho .
i read about good stuff here but was very disappointed .
we have had vietnamese food in other states before but here is the worst .
soup has no flavour and it seems to have excessive msg .
egg roll and fried rice is too greasy .
service is not friendly .
turns out this was n't the case .
wrong .
the entire restaurant could use a thorough cleaning .
i left , and do n't intend to return .
try tom 's diner or eat 'n park instead .
heck , go to a grocery store instead .
the food is n't something to rave about but it 's edible .
never a dull moment .
finding a good ol ' diner in pittsburgh is n't exactly easy .
the restaurant has the diner feel , no doubt .
you ca n't mess it up ) .
the food ranges from mediocre to bland .
worst food in pittsburgh .
i think the food is boring .
wrong !
_num_ but i rounded down .
i do n't want to be too mean .
had no desire to eat throughout the day .
this was some of the worst food i 've ever had .
the two times i 've been there i was unhappy .
cheap , average diner food .
ummm , we 're pretty sure my boyfriend got food poisoning here .
it 's disgusting .
the food is crap .
they screwed up a club sandwich & fries .
kind of gross if you ask me .
food can be pretty good , service can be pretty bad .
so , i came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast .
the toast was good , but i was too full to keep eating .
based on this one experience , i would come only for the pancakes .
service was really bad even though the place was half empty .
located in not such a great part of town .
food is just ok , grease upon grease .
waitresses do not make much of an effort .
we ordered wings and pierogies for appetizers , for which we waited _num_ minutes .
the wings were dry .
he did nothing to compensate us for the long wait .
this place is one of only a couple open in the burgh _num_ hours .
that 's an automatic star in this dead city .
the only items that are good there are the bacon and toast .
the food just is n't that great .
yeah , that place is that old and that outdated .
no parking = no visit from me .
- it 's _num_ and they have no website or menu .
it would take less than _num_ day of their time .
- they want $ _num_ for cheese on their eggs .
their chicken is better too .
a few of us went out after late night bowling to get some food .
it 's clear that cleanliness is not a priority here .
and the bathroom looks and smells like something out of the movie saw .
i do n't have time for this , i 'm very busy '' .
no need to be nasty .
typical diner look and menu .
i really do n't get the hype as the food was average at best .
puts it into a glass and serves it to someone else .
do not make the mistake and eat here .
overall , my experience eating here has been inconsistent .
when it was brought back , there was a small hair in it .
soup not hot , waitress and cook fighting loudly .
cash only is not an acceptable policy in _num_ .
this trend has to stop , it is not ok .
i refuse to patronize any business that only accepts cash .
this is a scam and highly unacceptable .
i dropped off my standard prescription today , with the head pharmacist .
he could n't have told me that prior ?
i could taste absolutely nothing from her veal .
the salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies .
then the bill came to over $ _num_ .
it was truly , truly just plain sad .
do n't waste your time !
after they microwaved it it was barely fit to eat .
some had flavorless chicken piccata , fish and eggplant parmigiana .
the only thing with an aroma in this place was the tomato sauce .
waited _num_ minutes for two glasses of wine .
it was very awkward considering it was a first date .
the drinks took forever , i had something floating in my wine .
the soup tasted spoiled , the tomatoes in my salad were frozen and mushy .
this place is trashy .
total dive bar with awful food and service .
neither of us touched our dinner , we were afraid to eat it .
diners beware , spend your money elsewhere .
not much for atmosphere .
the service , in my opinion , is often quite rude .
the `` ambiance '' is loud , dark , dingy and depressing .
sorry , but i just do n't get it .
this place is hyped as the be all end all of burgers .
the reason why i rate this place low is the atmosphere is abysmal .
i 've had better burgers almost everywhere .
i dropped them off while i parked the car .
she said they would n't seat them because i was n't there .
the burger was pretty good but , i 've had much better .
what i really did n't like about this place was the service .
we had to flag down our waitress just to get refills .
we were rushed through our meals like we were n't wanted !
nothing special here .
not sure what all the hype is about .
but the burger was n't memorable at all .
we proceed to wait another _num_ minutes until a _num_ top opened up .
never understood all the hype about this place .
the burgers are rather bland and burnt .
and the wait was always ridiculous to boot .
in practice , it 's not very pleasant to go there .
every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward .
the burger just falls apart in your hands ( or onto your lap ) .
i was disappointed .
i had a bacon cheeseburger and it was okay .
i did like the home fries , very yummy !
in all honesty i would 've rather had five guys or in-n-out burgers .
it 's not .
not even close .
i 've eaten there many times in the hopes that maybe i missed something .
oh but it 's not .
it 's not me .
it 's just not that good .
burgers are adequate - nothing special .
order something other than a burger and you do n't get much better .
this was my first and last time at this restaurant .
but i did n't send it back because i never send anything back .
i just ate it and it was a sloppy , greasy mess .
the bread was cheap and tasteless .
the home fries were just diced potatoes .
also , not one of us got ours cooked as ordered .
i just do n't understand the appeal .
i would consider a _num_ star rating if it were n't for them .
the decor is old school and seems satisfied in it 's current state .
however , it was absolutely nothing special .
also , the home fries were just mediocre .
i do n't understand all the rave reviews for this place .
as for me , i do n't think i 'll be back .
there did n't seem to be any seasoning of the meat whatsoever .
bland would be an understatement .
i had the kelly burger and it was just extremely massive and greasy .
the burger was so-so with little flavor , which was very disappointing .
the waitress made it seem as though it was my fault for bringing him .
the potato salad was awesome everything else was super sub par .
this is supposed to be the best burgers in the 'burgh .
if that were the case , i 'd stick to making my own .
baby on board , we walked in and waited to be greeted .
the inside looked a bit old and run down .
i would not suggest bringing a baby here .
the potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side .
bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty .
this was not the case .
my burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken .
overall , tessaro 's fell flat and left me hung out to dry .
went once , only due to bad weather , and would never go again .
mediocre food and mediocre service .
_num_ of us came here for dinner and ordered burgers and drinks .
bad customer service and to be honest we had bad service all around .
they also have a wind problem every time the front door is open .
clearly , customer service nor quality of food are valued .
the dust does n't end there .
_num_ of us plus drinks was $ _num_ .
worst service and seating ever !
food is ok but the service is a thumb down .
i would never come back .
for me , eating at tessaro 's is like eating a costco hotdog .
maybe i should cut down on the costco dogs ?
staff was friendly and drinks were reasonable but nothing to rave about .
however , i wo n't be back .
terrible service .
was really excited to try this out .
did n't wait long to be seated .
but waited over _num_ minutes for them to take our order .
waitresses were overwhelmed and avoided us .
lack concern makes me wonder if we will be back .
the wait for someone to take our drink order was rather long .
i 'm used to ordering medium and getting medium well at least .
i do n't see why people really like this place .
they were soggy , and not crispy at all .
there are better places in pittsburgh to get a burger and fries .
it seems as if this place is now more hit or miss .
the food went from amazing to mediocre without missing a beat .
even worse , no seasoning whatsoever .
probably not .
so , i am fed up with bad service from this state farm office .
no effing way .
just my experience , but come on people , really ?
i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time .
we walked in and there were already some people waiting for a table .
i was excited about dining at this place before _num_ minutes of frustration .
stuffed mushrooms , but my seafood pasta just came up bland and too oily .
the broccoli in it was overcooked and the shrimp were undercooked .
if i could give negative stars i certainly would for this place .
i walked in sat down , greeted by friendly staff and great decor .
we sat outside and the service was very slow .
tonight , however , was just awful .
it was way too thick and absolutely tasteless .
it tasted like that yellow spray they use on grills .
the waitress did n't take the coke off of the bill until i asked .
it was very crowded due to little italy days in bloomfield .
we should have requested another waitress at that moment .
would never consider going back .
there were nine people in the bar section .
yelp need to have a zero rating for places like this .
just awful .
my boyfriend and i went to dinner here last saturday .
our food took forever and when it got there i was highly disappointed .
my alfredo was tasteless .
the veal was soggy and chewy and the sauce was sub par .
took nearly two hours for everyone in our party to get our food .
this was really disappointing .
i went out with three others on a friday night to grab some dinner .
unfortunately , we were all pretty underwhelmed with most of the dinner .
crispy on the outside , creamy and cheesy on the inside .
the entrees , however , left much to be desired .
everything tasted like nothing .
everything was just bland and disappointing .
pasta was watery and very limp .
presentation was so so and the taste of the food was mediocre .
i will not be returning .
these guys are definitely lazy !
pesto gnocchi okay , tiramisu okay ( except for the canned whipped cream ) .
_num_ star for food , gross !
_num_ stars for plate glass window people watching !
i had the linguine carbonara and it was more like scrambled eggs and noodles .
bland noodles .
i really would n't go back again .
( this becomes important later . )
they were significantly cheaper .
we waited fifteen or so minutes , the shots were consumed , etc .
( i believe it was $ _num_ total . )
i felt terrible for her in that situation .
nobody else even ordered drinks while we were there .
but this was not what i had in mind .
but the bed was a big disappointment .
the mattress was borderline uncomfortable .
i would not stay here , it 's not worth the money they charge .
my room came with an awesome jacuzzi .
looking into this place , they have no website .
there is no excuse .
i should n't have to look for something , it should obviously be there .
i read online that it opened at 11am , wrong .
it opens at _num_ .
not a good first impression .
not good .
thankfully they give it to me without further lip .
total for one waffle cone with sprinkles = $ _num_ .
the ice cream was nothing special .
not here .
but there 's nothing special about this place .
make sure your opening and closing time is listed correctly .
rating - _num_ out of _num_ .
it was generous for the `` _num_ scoop '' order .
in the future i 'll stick with scoops for my neighborhood ice cream fix .
coming here was usually pretty exciting .
( here as in the city , not silky 's . )
this place is just not our usual dive bar .
i was not even acknowledged .
this was a moderately steady thursday night .
i was n't standing behind the people 's sitting at the bar .
by `` multiple times '' i mean _num_ or _num_ times .
they would n't look at me .
this is about _num_ minutes after i arrived .
`` ill tell the waitress . ''
me : `` please may i just have my beer ? ''
it 's extremely frustrating .
my experience here was terrible .
a _num_ minute wait for a draft beer on a slow night ?
no thanks .
just there last evening after a _num_ hour shift at work .
the server apologized and offered to get the correct sandwhich for me to go .
not impressed .
the juice from the tacos also made the tater tots extremely soggy .
everyone else in my group was disappointed in some way with our visit .
mediocre food and also over-priced .
this silky 's pub place is a complete joke .
out of five orders , only two were done correctly .
he talked loudly across the whole restaurant to staff members back in the kitchen .
what could have been a very positive experience was absolutely ruined by this man .
so , yeah , the smell .
you play russian roulette with your quarters every time .
lol is the most expensive laundromat i 've ever been to !
so why is laundry on liberty so expensive and so busted ?
now i 'm sad , real sad .
the front staff is very curt and short .
edit : in my original review i stated this procedure was $ _num_ .
for my car the average oil change runs about $ _num_ .
on most visits it takes em about _num_ minutes .
no problems with my oil change .
honesty today must have been forgotten .
and that they were going to charge me $ _num_ for it .
they cracked my oil pan and it cost me four hundred dollars to repair .
avoid at all cost .
they will ruin your car .
terrible experience .
overpriced , terrible customer service , and long wait times .
i went to jiffy lube for a routine oil change .
very bad service .
they are extremely slow .
when i told them that , they just lied and said they did .
this place sucks .
they are incredibly slow and ridiculously over priced .
the gentleman told me it would be about _num_ minutes .
very long wait .
very very slow service .
the workers do n't seem to care about how long it takes to wait .
jiffy lube sucked .
took over an hour , cost $ _num_ , broke my air filter .
um , hello ... how about an apology for wasting my time ?
no thanks .
there was absolutely no salt of them when they came out .
the turkey burger was seasoned well , but it was dry as a bone .
lot _num_ is ultimately a forgettable lunch destination .
too busy with your iphone ?
my merlot was decent but the calamari was not .
plus i think i found a fry or two with the vegetables .
also lot _num_ had some funky smells throughout the time that we were there .
service could have been better .
i might return for drinks but only drinks .
the food is bad !
boring .
this appetizer reminded me of my mother 's irish cooking : tasteless .
a simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem .
entree _num_ : beer battered fish and mac and cheese .
entree _num_ : fish tacos .
ok , so they were n't bad , but the fish was dry .
the attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream .
the chef , however , needs a bit of training .
i am hoping that my experience here was an off night .
there was only one waitress on for the whole restaurant , upstairs and down .
another twenty six minutes pass and husbands food comes .
both the waitress and the bartender were downright hostile .
not my scene .
the food is mediocre ( at best ) .
the place is a total dump .
we ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed .
a breakfast sandwich had weird burnt meat on it .
it just is n't for me .
this place has the worst french fries i have ever tasted .
all i tasted was burnt oil .
i could not even eat one !
also the sandwich did not stick together like a melted sandwich should .
ugh .
_num_ out of _num_ is not great .
i am so disappointed .
disgusting .
do not eat here .
i spent $ _num_ for only one edible thing worth $ _num_ .
so pissed !
the sign says it , the looks of this place are not the best .
i 've had much worse .
disappointing .
pasta was not homemade and sauces mediocre at best .
wine selection is very weak .
eggplant parm was a little better than average .
i 'm sorry , this place is simply not good .
unfortunately , it is yet another example of poorly made americanized italian food .
yes bread , this is not your best .
contrary to popular believe , this is not traditional italian !
this is what some would refer to as , terrible and heavy .
words could not describe my disappointment .
i 'll admit it , i 'm already an italian food snob .
is this what italian food in pittsburgh has come too ?
not real italian .
imitation crab meat at an italian restaurant does n't fly .
do n't worry but i wo n't come close to this restaurant again .
i was n't really a fan .
i 've made much better at home .
which was dry , overcooked and lukewarm .
did we catch them on a bad day ?
today , half the lettuce i had on my caesar salad was rotten .
i have no idea why it ever left the kitchen .
thanks but probably wo n't be back .
both meals were served barely warm .
the decor was old _num_ 's which could have charm but this did n't .
both plates were mediocre at best .
this was my first time here and i will never go back .
to start off when we walked in the place reeked of piss .
oh and that 's not the end of it .
i paid _num_ $ all together and it should have been free .
alexander 's offers some of the worst italian food i 've ever had .
unfortunately , the entrees were no better .
my girlfriend ordered chicken alfredo .
my mom ordered the mushroom ravioli , which was completely bland .
needless to say , my cannoli was awful .
do n't expect fresh food .
i was extremely disappointed w/ my experience at alexander 's last evening .
i had visited this restaurant in the past and remember it being much better ?
first of all , house chianti tasted like vinegar .
however , we were not offered any and forgot about it until this morning .
i am _num_ and i was probably youngest patron .
if you are looking for culinary experience avoid it .
it was a small side salad of iceberg lettuce and croutons with italian dressing .
what i received reminded me of mrs grass soup .
really bad italian food .
probably the worst i 've ever had .
the worst american version of italian food .
if you 're famous , why is there never anyone in your restaurant ?
the sandwich itself was , well , mediocre at best .
prices were okay , but no great bargain .
i have n't been back .
i rarely write negative reviews .
what a disappointment .
the salad was nothing special .
the spring rolls were nothing special and heavy on something off flavored .
the server got my order wrong .
i think it was overpriced for a pittsburgh restaurant as well .
this place was horrible .
i was very excited to try this place .
the pad thai was dry and tasteless .
i agree _num_ % on maggie g 's review .
ill pass i 've had better thai for less .
no more trying out different thai places in the city .
the food at thai cuisine is more pitiful than my sense of direction .
the carrots and broccoli was cooked beyond recognition .
okay thai food , nothing special , and overpriced .
ordered the eggplant with shrimp , veggie fried rice , and chicken satay .
eggplant was okay but lacked adequate quantities of shrimp .
however , would n't say this is very authentic thai food .
this was gross and a waste of _num_ dollars .
thai gourmet a few blocks down is awesome ... too bad they were closed .
the spring rolls were good and the dipping sauce was ok , nothing special .
i did n't think it was that good .
worst thai restaurant in pittsburgh .
i was greatly disappointed by this restaurant .
the place was very busy and noisy .
further , there did n't seem to be any seasoning on the steak .
it was tough and boring .
unfortunately , my head is sometimes up my own behind .
the place was much less noisy and crowded at my second visit .
the wings were awful .
they were large , tough and tasteless .
the sauce they were drowning in seemed to have almost a chemical taste .
the pasta dish would have been very good had it been seasoned enough .
the shrimp were perfectly cooked , though , and i was thankful for that .
nevertheless , i will not go there , again .
do n't waste your money !
my favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno .
they also did away with the _num_ cent wing night .
i just had the worst meal ever here .
very strange place .
not a big deal just thought it odd .
just meh sorta flavorless .
good place _num_ a large group to drink get apps tho .
went to getaway last night for famous fajitas .
decided to give them another chance and was disappointed .
5:30 on a saturday and only two other tables were occupied .
at noon on a friday i called getaway to place an order for wings .
i told my friend to forget about it .
( oh , heck no ! )
my wife ended up going to the bathroom for paper towels .
what an awful experience .
my steak hoagie was actually two mini sandwiches .
i would n't recommend it .
sorry chef jeff .
absolutely horrible service .
no thanks .
in a word : forgettable .
the last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye .
it 's not 5-star , it 's pizza .
i suspect it would be really delicious cold , for breakfast .
it was late and on the way home with nothing at home to eat .
stopped by fiori 's , have n't been there in years .
the pizza was just sweet without much other taste , almost like ketchup !
this place is popular , but it is just is not for me !
i really do n't understand the hype of this place .
the pizza was just ok .
it was decently greasy and the crust was n't all that special .
sure , it 's friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable .
it took another _num_ minutes before he actually got the pizza .
_num_ hour and _num_ mins is ridiculously long to wait !
they should have cut off orders if they were that overwhelmed !
the sauce tasted like sugar and the crust was bland .
after that , everything else is what i consider the personal taste part .
the sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me .
i wo n't be going back , just because my personal taste .
that was really unprofessional .
the bottom and the top rated with grease .
it was disgusting .
the red sauce tasted like it was ketchup with sugar added .
loaded with cheese that had pools of grease swimming on it .
it was still dripping with grease .
i removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables .
i assure you this place is n't it .
garbage !
after all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude .
the pie it self was a real mess .
the dough is some of the worst dough i have had yet in pittsburgh .
it is very dense and flavorless with no crunch at all .
its a dry dough too , very dry .
the sauce is very forgettable and watery .
and just leave this one alone .
i am giving it a _num_ out of _num_ .
really do n't get the high praise for their pizza .
their sauce is so thin and tasteless .
the cheese is almost too much .
i was quickly greeted by paul - who was great !
they continued to stare for several minutes , unbelievably unprofessional .
sadly i will never purchase a vehicle here again because of this experience .
which you failed , because of your tire .
you could leave a message , but they 'll never get back to you .
do n't waste your time and money here .
then shortly after , i needed to replace the alternator or the like .
this was a friday , and he said he 'd call back on monday .
monday , tuesday and wednesday came and went .
first , their clothing is arranged by color , not by size .
the upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store .
we wo n't be back to this one .
was n't worth it for me .
parking sucks .
just really lots of junk .
it is a cash only establishment and the staff was very rude .
i 'd rather spend my money at goodwill !
this used to be one of my favorite thrift stores .
it is now grossly over priced .
and it seems like everybody that goes in there are trashy and rude .
it tends to bring in the worst of people .
get the diagnosis and get several estimates to compare .
it seems like all these hvac guys are out to take advantage .
do not use , awful experience !
my house is under 1,000 sf .
he was there for approximately _num_ minutes .
i feel ripped off .
very sad to find that donuts are made the day before .
same goes for the provolone wheel .
the bread was not fresh either .
i 'm genuinely disappointed with the recent changes .
we stuck it out and left with no intention to return .
the icing was not damaged though as they were so stale they were hard .
so i contacted this bakery for a wedding cake approximately _num_ months in advance .
i do n't regret it at all .
what a nightmare !
the cupcakes were average at best .
sadly , yelp failed me this time around .
( _num_ ) i called multiple times but could n't reach anyone .
( _num_ ) left messages and no one called me back .
( _num_ ) they do n't have ready access to email .
if you send them an email , they do n't check it .
brutal .
they just do n't run a very professional operation .
terrible !
only had a bite of that and threw it away .
owner is a terrible terrible person .
tossed me out for no good reason .
it was like pizza soup in a crust bowl .
they do not cook directly on the brick though , they use pizza screens .
they are wasting so much money on cheese its sad .
fake words aside , this pizza really sucks guys .
this was our first time trying this place since moving to castle shannon .
the pizza was really really greasy .
we also got an order of _num_ hot wings .
they were also extremely greasy and had zero flavor of any kind of sauce .
their texture was rubbery and they had a `` reheated '' taste to them .
they were pretty terrible .
we wo n't be ordering from here again .
completely unprofessional and ridiculous .
none of this is exaggeration .
almost every order i 've placed had something forgotten or incorrect .
literally the worst experience ever .
only _num_ stars .
yelp as well as the online website said they close at _num_ .
worst mcdonalds !
someone needs fired !
seriously the worst mcdonalds i 've ever been to .
service is always slow .
but the situation inside is fairly ridiculous .
every mcdonalds has employees that hate their job , but never show it .
i hate this location .
every time , we have a worse experience with customer service .
my cashier never handed me a cup for my drink .
over time i 've been ignored , greeted with `` what do you want ?
worst service ever !
heck no !
worst experience ever !
will defiantly not go there again !
this leaves the meat dry and tasteless .
hostess was great , service was adequate .
the food is terrible .
if i could give zero stars i would .
ugh .
terrible food .
disgusting food .
third terrible .
the entrees are horrible .
the apps were good but do n't eat dinner you 'll regret it .
never going back .
this used to be one of our favorite restaurants .
the new pitas tasted like a doughy pancake .
my wife 's dinner was bland .
it was that bad .
my hope is that they fix their problems .
avoid at all costs .
i would n't go back .
well , this place is beyond horrible .
if i could give negative stars i would .
the service , however , was terrible .
no wonder the service was horrible !
will never stop here again .
horrible , rude service .
_num_ minute wait for fast food ?
made me feel uncomfortable , he was kinda nasty and condescending .
however , every times i drive thru pittsburgh , i always stopped here .
furthermore , i have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce .
shrimp was hard to chew .
there was no aroma from garlic or onion .
i suspect this is probably made by the guy who station the fryer .
i purchase those passing pittsburgh , not really possible asking for refund .
it was so bad , i would not dear to try again .
i could n't eat it .
this is n't the first time that i have had this problem here .
takeout is gross .
i wo n't be back .
no changing tables in the bathroom .
no chop sticks or soy sauce unless you ask for it .
interior is dark and dated .
dry rice , no flavor , greasy .
wonton soup and a mediocre fortune earns this one ( _num_ ) golden star .
it was my last time , i will ever stop again .
stopped in with my daughter we just wanted something small to eat .
i left and very disappointed .
i have been a customer of sesame inn for many , many years .
two stars because they seem to not be able to get it together .
people were sat after us and have already received food .
either case , i 'm not thrilled .
not that the food was bad it just was n't good !
never ever get the all-you-can-eat .
they give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi .
also , service was unfriendly .
my son and i stopped by china gate after a movie in the galleria .
there was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast .
i refused .
there is such a thing as food too fast .
tonight was the worst experience we have had for a very long time .
and another which was not the one my husband had ordered .
the restaurant is understaffed , poorly managed , and the staff is badly trained .
too bad .
one star for the unpleasant experience i have had at this store .
it 's a shame he could not assist me with some grace and respect .
i will not be returning here for any musical needs .
i was a bridesmaid very recently and the bride got her dress here .
the dress comes in _num_ months later and is the wrong color .
i would never recommend this boutique to a bride unless you want added stress .
there are plenty of other bridal salons that would be much nicer and accommodating .
incredibly unfriendly staff , completely clueless consultant .
if i asked the price , she did n't know and did n't look .
think twice people before going here .
update : i received a very much appreciated phone call from the owner today .
she stated that she would go ask to see if something could be done .
they of course could care less about me .
what horrible service this place gives !
i wish i could give this no stars and a thumbs down !
the bride chose a dress hoping it would look better in a smaller size .
they know my measurements , they should know what size i should get !
the cost of the alterations were $ _num_ !
to date that has not happened .
the selection was not unique , though there were plenty of dresses .
it seems ridiculous , actually .
in addition , the knowledge of the associate was lackluster .
the oven was way too hot for this type of pizza .
it was also an outrageous $ _num_ dollars .
it was also fairly small , but that was almost to be expected .
we also shared a pasta dish which was incredibly overpriced .
we also had a serious problem with the timing of the food .
hmm a bit misleading .
but my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted .
the blond hostess refused .
as for the food and drink , it was just fine .
i wo n't be coming here again .
essentially three pieces of toast with various toppings .
certainly , this was not worth the $ _num_ price .
our server was attentive , almost to a fault .
way overpriced for just ok food .
on a tuesday night , there was a long wait .
the food was prompt , and the salad was more than enough to share .
the pizza was simply ok .
also , do not use multiple credit cards .
our pizza was burnt .
it tasted like charcoal .
but told our server we could not eat the burnt pizza .
it was cold and not a good portion .
i got a huge hot pepper that burnt the crap out of my lip .
just not a good value for the $ .
there were n't even many toppings to make it soggy .
probably give it another shot but not my first choice considering the prices .
i ordered the margarita , sauce , cheese and basil .
it was a wet tasteless mess .
i may return if craving a good caesar .
we will not be going back .
friday night is apparently not the night to go .
you can wait for _num_ minutes at the wine bar . ''
we repeatedly got dirty looks from the staff throughout our meal though .
by 6:30 , there were still a number of empty tables .
then there 's the main restaurant that i really was n't that impressed with .
the food i ordered was penne alla vodka , which was pretty tasty .
but for $ _num_ , and that 's all you get ?
and never refilled our empty water glasses .
lo and behold at _num_ minutes it comes out .
bland and soggy as we 've ever tasted .
very rude .
worst service in years .
unimpressive food .
the pasta i got was good , but nothing to write home about .
the only thing i will give them credit for their italian wedding soup .
overall , not impressed .
i probably wo n't return .
this used to be one of my absolute favorite places to eat .
i really like the pizza and marinated vegetables .
sadly i can not support a business that provides such poor service .
no salad .
no meat .
no dice .
better deals and better food at a mall food court .
$ _num_ for wedding soup ?
$ _num_ for gnocchi ?
no more .
what was worse was the pizza was just average .
it 's so cold - like sit with your coat on cold .
so disappointed .
we dined rather early , so there was no wait .
overall , a disappointing dining experience .
however , there were three hostesses at the bar chatting and seemingly doing nothing .
the restaurant was by no means crowded ( this was a sunday ) .
it does n't make sense .
the wine : _num_ inches served in a huge glass .
with all of the fabulous choices in the south hills , pick another destination .
this restaurant is going downhill .
first thing i knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate .
they replaced the normal wooden board , and replaced it with a plate .
a white , boring , incredibly small plate .
food remains ok but prices have more than doubled .
i do n't return on principle .
their market square location worse .
waitress has n't checked on us in half an hour .
would rate the food , but have no clue because we are still waiting .
ridiculous .
waiter was not thrilled to be at work on a wednesday at 5pm .
my pizza was okay , nothing yummy .
way too over priced .
go for drinks and nothing more .
i 've been wanting to try this place for awhile .
disappointed but not giving up , we ordered one of each and proceeded .
the bread was thick and doughy ( clearly a filler ) .
i eat out almost every night of the week .
it doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine , it is very chinese .
and i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant .
i expected bland sushi .
but hey , it 's pittsburgh .
let 's face it , this is not japanese food .
the food is ok but it is really more or less chinese food .
man , was i wrong .
the sushi was not fresh .
the sushi was n't rolled tight either .
otherwise , i really would n't recommend this place to other people .
there are no descriptions for any of the rolls .
they do not offer low sodium soy sauce .
the wait for _num_ rolls and _num_ pieces of sashimi took over _num_ minutes .
actually , everything i ate was mushy .
the side soup is luke warm , soup should always be hot .
waited about another _num_ minutes after we finished our food to receive our check .
however , they deserve one star because they do have one amazing thing there .
their ginger dressing is unbelievable .
miso soup had an odd taste this visit .
our waitress was mia most of the night .
i did not have a good experience here tonight .
it was fried tofu in soy sauce with red pickled chinese chilli .
so disappointed .
we ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi .
false advertising at its best -- should n't that be illegal ?
a group was sat without the reservation ahead of us .
we have been ordering food from little tokyo for almost _num_ years now .
over the last _num_ months i have to report they have lost their edge .
this is not japanese food , period .
horrible .
i swear it was worse than my first experience .
the locals that like this joint must have smoker destroyed taste buds .
the dough has that typical bad salty cracker pittsburgh type taste to it .
the flavor of the dough is generic and salty .
the dough was also fairly dense .
the cheese ruined this pie .
all in all this pizza just sucks .
some good some bad .
even burger king does n't microwave their breakfast !
the chili soup was n't hot .
neither of us had cash on us , ( umm ... sorry ? )
the screens were tiny and the women 's restroom smelled of stale piss .
odds are , you 'd get a better experience at home .
such a shame .
filthy , bad seats , more expensive than others .
we wo n't return here .
she said she did n't care and her manager did n't care .
i did n't care .
i sat in the little snack area and drank it .
overpriced snacks , and the sound on the movie was awful .
why does this place always smell bad ?
this is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud .
food is n't that great .
lots of tv 's though .
just do n't expect to get anything else out of it .
the ambiance is a little strange .
the service was also overwhelmed and really slow .
the service was terrible .
sorry , not sorry .
this place does n't do it for me at all .
do n't bother eating here .
a complete waste of money , avoid at all costs .
avoid at all cost .
_num_ there service is awful , _num_ there prices are awful .
sad to see it go .
but i 'm sure the mall 's rent killed them .
sad to see it go .
at the time , it was the premier cigar shop in the pittsburgh area .
the store is extremely pricey and nothing really interested us .
last week i went in with a busted window screen frame .
now it wo n't fit .
she slowly responded `` yeah '' hardly looking up .
i stood there for a second and realized she was blatantly blowing me off .
i guess because the big box stores are cheaper and maybe more accessible .
i am so frustrated with this service .
i should have just gone to giant eagle .
very disappointed .
this was a horrible experience .
i am extremely disappointed and will never order or recommend them for anything !
the galleria ... it 's definitely catered to the upper class .
i really do n't have much desire to go here !
management will not care about your complaint and certainly will not apologize .
and , no , i 'm not making this up .
to which my response would have been , `` oh i 'm so sorry .
none of them responded to me .
the management team of this mall would get negative stars if that was possible .
after getting my `` window '' they never showed up .
no call , nothing .
i sat around for an entire saturday waiting and no one ever called me .
it was horrible .
they also promised me a partial refund for my massive inconvenience .
i should have refused delivery and just got my money back .
i asked them three times to please try and they refused all three times .
if you are going to shop here , do not use their delivery service .
wo n't be going back .
wo n't be going back .
worst experience with a hairdresser ever , at this location .
yeah , that 's why i booked one at your salon .
horrible salon ... dirty , also , just as a side note .
online , their women 's haircut price is quoted at $ 30+ .
no , she went ahead anyway .
so go there instead is the best advice i can give .
for many , many years i had the same massage therapist .
massage but still had a _num_ hr .
wait which i left to run some errands .
it is very disappointing after having wonderful experiences here for over _num_ decades !
the worst salon experience of my life .
i gave her the benefit of the doubt & i completely regret it .
the first visit took almost seven hours , not _num_ .
it looked horrible .
she left about 1-2 inches of my naturally black roots !
i felt horrible .
she 's either incompetent or she ruined my hair on purpose .
she damaged my hair so badly i ended up having _num_ inches cut off .
i would give them zero stars if that was an option .
this place sucks .
they still have not apologized when they lost her insurance card .
i paid $ _num_ for shipping .
weird experience .
i have no clue what they gave me .
they just wanted to work , i guess .
i chose a sugar cookie and mexican cookie .
i 'm not wasting my calories on a bad cookie .
the mexican cookie was just the same consistency .
sorry buds !
the lady who works their , is super rude and never smiles .
the customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers .
it 's always dirty .
do n't think the floor has ever been washed .
it 's like they hate their lives .
wish there was a choice of no stars .
there was no noise control so sleep was impossible .
absurd .
horrible experience .
quite possibly the worst experience i have ever had dealing with a clothing store .
why would i spend hundreds of dollars on more suits ?
overpriced merchandise that does not last .
even the shoes fell apart after a few months .
purchased two suits and other items for my son , spending over $ _num_ .
i could understand if they were worn a lot , but they were not .
my recommendation would be to not buy suits , shirts or shoes here .
the salespeople are not pushy .
the team went out of their way to get us in quickly and efficiently .
the closet doors would keep falling off onto my little children .
we called about the issue and they sent someone over right away .
my overall point is just be careful working with them .
and not giving real receipts ( they use hand written ones ! )
i rest my case : avoid ten toes on walnut ladies !
losing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless .
the coffee is okay , nothing special .
this place just keeps getting worse and worse .
started with the bathrooms ... rarely cleaned , rarely working .
so long story short , this place is packed .
it 's a little annoying .
i 'm not a coffee snob i can do with it or without it .
but it seemed like i was absolutely bothering the staff this morning .
i 'm not a shady side hipster but an average person in workout gear .
felt like i was in someone else 's hood .
get over yourselves people .
if you 've got stuff to do , do n't bother coming here .
they apparently do n't care about your time or money .
servers here can be really rude .
it was n't even that she said it .
i wo n't be back .
the wifi signal is weak .
the drinks are not so great .
the frozen carmel coffee drink was much better than fruit smoothie .
it was gross .
slightly better than starbucks , but that 's not saying much .
it 's sad to me that someone would open a coffee shop like this .
so i decide to try a coffee tree for once .
i walk in , look around , look at the menu ... hmmm .
sorry , just not interested .
it must not have been bad because i do n't remember anything about it .
minus _num_ stars for not being much better than starbucks .
unfortunately , the wi-fi here is miserable .
its connection is also very spotty .
for a coffee shop , the food and drinks here are mediocre at best .
that 's about where the positives stop .
wifi is spotty .
espresso is pretty bad .
i must be missing something because this place seemed expensive for dry cleaning .
this place is out of my dry cleaning budget !
its owner , gary , enjoys parking in handicapped parking spaces .
this time , the staff were new , loud and mean .
as chance would have it , the owner gary was around .
the damage was done .
they just keep finding excuses and trying not to be responsible for it .
so disappointed !
i interacted with staff to get help with a machine that was n't working .
do n't expect any help when things get ruined .
i usually do both dry cleaning and wash and fold here .
i will never do any business with this jerk off ever again .
i have never been treated so rudely in my entire life .
i told him that i would rather donate the items to a theater .
will never return to the store .
i went here to fix a bad hair cut at the last minute .
i was livid and called to complain .
they offered me nothing .
terrible customer service will never book with them again .
my experience did not live up to my expectations at all .
i could have gotten a better wax at a cheap nail salon .
my eyebrow still has n't grown back to its normal shape .
not worth your money !
i wo n't be going back to see him again .
this place is awful .
i mean , so so bad .
she rushed me into picking colors for my nails and toes .
water temp on the chair got too cold too fast .
absolutely horrible customer service .
not sure what star rating to give .
it 's happened everytime i go and it 's really unprofessional .
as for beverages , they really skimp .
despite the spa pricing this is not the spa treatment .
price was as i expected for a nice looking salon .
the bed was dirty too .
gross .
she was clearly in a hurry .
well what a mistake i made .
they booked me with a guy by the name of jason .
it cost me _num_ to get extensions so my hair looked thicker .
i can not recommend this salon .
( $ _num_ for a hair cut i was n't satisfied with ) .
ok , so i really wanted to like this place .
that 's about as far as it goes though .
the haircut was $ _num_ .
they did n't wash my hair and the haircut took about _num_ minutes .
then , i went to go hang out with my best friend immediately after .
they charge me for their mistake .
but that 's apparently the way they do it .
the head massage was painful and rough .
i probably wo n't be returning for a hair appointment .
but i am not rushing back .
so disappointed with this place .
so disappointed with this place .
poor customer service and they were rude .
i was disappointed .
i am not a fan of this place .
please do not give them business .
you are better off going to another nearby dry cleaner .
first , they messed up one of our pants badly .
when i say they messed up one of our pants , they destroyed it .
rather , they were extremely rude and defensive .
for your own sake and peace of mind , do not give them business .
do not use this cleaner .
quality is poor .
refused to replace them or compensate me for the loss .
they do not stand by their mistakes .
have been waiting for _num_ business shirts and suits for over _num_ weeks .
customer service is poor .
this place is extremely overrated .
the salmon was ok but not worth the $ _num_ either .
i 've been here a few times and have always been disappointed .
last night the service was especially lackluster .
the first time i went it was okay , but was very forgettable .
unfortunately , the food was mixed .
i had the chicken ramen soup for a main course .
it just was n't very good .
this includes the broth and the chicken .
as it is , i wish i 'd gone somewhere else .
dear pittsburgh , we are foodies from boston .
it 's unacceptable .
a restaurant like just should be nowhere near your top _num_ .
i would prefer to leave _num_ stars .
the pancakes were ok , a little mushy but flavorful .
i wish i could remember the other thing , but it was better .
when the bill comes , it is _num_ dollars .
and is _num_ dollars a glass .
drinking scotch in pittsburgh has been fun so far .
for appetizer , we had the kimchi pancakes , which were not fully cooked .
went to soba to celebrate my sons birthday .
quality of food was not at all what was expected for the price .
i wish they did n't put fried batter all over it though .
last i had the vegetarian curry dish , the only vegetarian main i found .
it was boring and not enough curry gravy with plain white rice !
the potatoes were also undercooked with not much flavor in the dish overall .
it was very cold .
everything took a long time to come out and the service was very poor .
needless to say i was extremely disappointed .
it was not enjoyable .
for the very first time the food was awful .
a pulled pork appetizer was passable , nowhere near the dish it replaced .
find a new chef quickly .
vietnamese beef noodles were bland and flavorless .
the menu lists them as including jalapeno , but there was no heat whatsoever .
very very disappointing .
thai corn soup jumbo crab ?
pad thai at a fusion place ?
tandoori salmon was average .
i still do n't understand why they served their fancy cream soda warm .
a cup given with no ice and a bottle of soda ?
why were n't their any ice in the glass ?
maybe it is really just me who prefer cold sodas .
show off how much money you can waste in a night .
after the renovation the place lost its center !
... another one bites the dust !
wrong !
the server went out of her way to make us feel uncomfortable .
no , we did not order any super fancy dishes .
lost _num_ stars for that .
it was horrible .
the fish was tough and the other dish was simply inedible .
this place is far too expensive to be serving food poorly prepared .
way too much hype for such underwhelming food .
sadly , i was grossly disappointed .
it was nothing that would make me want to come back .
it was sad , really .
but it was downhill from there .
it was dry and average , at best .
and fallen far .
it 's just not that good .
nothing special .
service is sketchy here at best .
first off , i can not comment on the food .
so , we were n't allowed to sit at the bar or a table .
those expectations kind of fell flat .
service here on a saturday night was atrocious .
_num_ after tip .
it 's good , but too expensive .
i do n't think the price worth the food .
the portion is too small .
i mean really loud .
i have never placed a bad review of a restaurant until now .
i will not recommend this establishment in the future .
not planning to come back and recommend everyone to stay away from this place .
painfully mediocre : small rolls , $ _num_ miso soup , drinks were reasonable .
rolls small lacking substance .
boring and expensive .
however , i 'm in pittsburgh , where can i go ?
these place are virtually the same .
no ... these bagels are about the same you would get anywhere .
okay bagels though a little overpriced .
have consistently had rude customer service .
really turns me off .
wo n't be going back even though the bagels are okay .
i 'm not totally sure why i keep going back here .
it was super busy and only _num_ employees were making food .
the coffee 's terrible .
poor customer service .
not worth the time and money to go here .
i go once or twice a week roughly , but never again .
but then again he knows everything is crap in his store .
it 's all crap .
do you like egg & bacon bagel sandwiches ?
they 'll cook the egg and bacon in their crap microwave for you .
tastes like crap but whatever , they serve it .
just like the butter and jelly packets sitting in the booth at denny 's .
but do n't feel this way .
the fellow who runs this crap store may be one .
was somewhat disappointed with my order from bagel factory today .
not horrible , just nothing to write home about .
i just found the worst breakfast spot in pittsburgh .
i 'm not kidding .
the egg and cheese were disgusting .
worst place ever !
bad food - ordered a bagel sandwich - yuck !
and the customer service was horrible .
apparently the guy was the owner , but he was beyond rude .
the coffee was expensive and tasted like dirt .
avoid this place as all costs .
we also tried the hummus which was pretty good .
friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad .
they both said they were pretty good , if not a little dry .
then we had to wait _num_ minutes to get our bill .
she was not present for about _num_ minutes after we were sat .
she disappeared for about _num_ minutes before returning .
she served us our drinks then immediately left for another table .
she returned not long after and said she was alright .
i really could n't believe this .
what the hell ?
this place is going downhill fast .
first off , our waitress just was n't good .
bacon does n't take that long to cook .
so , that was really disappointing .
but it was n't over .
there were literally exactly four sad little pieces .
only because i live nearby .
this place just bored me .
really do n't know what to say .
bored , bored , bored , bored , bored .
mmm not too happy with my recent experience at harris grill .
we ended up with our glasses 3/4 full and a watered down juice cocktail .
ours was n't plain and simple .
harris grill , i think your menu is trying too hard .
first place i went on my visit to pittsburgh .
i do n't really have a good review for this place .
bland and overcooked .
it 's not even good bacon !
i have nothing good to say about this place .
waitstaff has a pretty poor knowledge of their own drink menu .
avoid harris grill .
this place offers really poor service .
the waitstaff go out of their way to not help you .
we stopped going after we got some serious attitude from our waiter .
i do n't enjoy doing it .
almost every time i have been let down .
appetizers : nothing really wrong here .
$ _num_ for two fish tacos ?
i do n't hate anything on the harris grill menu .
sure , harris grill gets crowded , especially on the weekends .
no apologies , no offer to comp a side or a dessert .
bad form , harris grill .
but truth be told , i 'll probably be back .
because i really want to like harris grill .
the food is not incredible and the service is always mediocre at best .
i thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor .
then the waitress asked me if i knew the chicken itself was spicy .
the menu said nothing about that , so i had no idea .
zero stars for service .
zero stars for price .
once seated , service was extremely slow .
_num_ min from when seated . )
service remained poor .
the place was mostly empty .
not so much .
terrible .
but again we watched table after table go empty and stay dirty .
and then the waitress only brought two of the three beverages .
the third took another _num_ minutes .
the menu was prix fixed at $ _num_ .
( they had run out of home fries ) .
my eggs benedict was good , so was my bloody mary .
that said , i counted only _num_ dishes with any vegetables at all .
the coffee was disappointing -- it came with plastic cups of half & half .
was n't impressed by their sunday brunch .
did n't like the presentation of the buffet .
the salad was made with iceberg lettuce and did n't look appetizing .
in all , it 's really nothing special , just very basic .
there 're not much options on the menu .
i tried the pasta once and it was tasteless .
so i was in need of a lunch and off to the garden .
two grape size tomatoes , and two thin slices of cucumber .
i do n't understand why this place is so popular .
i 've been there _num_ times and each time the food was pretty gross .
the only option for brunch is to get the buffet .
they were packed and could n't keep enough food out .
and , insult to injury , my bloody mary was watered down .
very hit or miss place .
i will never go back to this place again !
it was calamari on top of some salad with thai chili sauce dressing .
it is just disgusting .
i stay _num_ blocks away from harris grill .
what turns me off a bit , it always seems dirty .
the bathroom smells , the menus seem filthy , but i like the food !
terrible terrible service .
seemed cranky and overworked and ruined the experience completely .
ugh .
horrible experience .
salmon salad was not good at all .
will not be going back ever .
my _num_ star is as misleading as their drink menu .
we greeted her before she greeted us which i find rude .
she did not ask us anything when we were shopping .
she just sat there and read a magazine .
never , ever use these incompetent people for property management .
we 've had too many problems to list all of them .
we ca n't pay something if we do n't know how much to pay .
so completely frustrating .
the equipment would often break down and never get fixed .
it was hard to find a machine .
terribly overrated .
the actual equipment is ok , but the locker rooms are pretty bad .
the reason you would stick to this gym is the classes .
parking is difficult to come by , and you have to pay .
there has to be better gyms in the area .
terrible experience !
very disappointing and frustrating .
gross much ?
the gym also has barely any lighting .
its ridiculous and the policy needs to be changed asap .
update ... shadyside inn refunded the charges from our stay .
the building we stayed in was not full .
if i could give the place zero stars , i would .
great location but low on amenities .
`` it 's not coming off !
also most hotels offer no free parking , shadyside suites did .
the bedroom however seemed to dull car noise a little better .
hot water , not much of it low water pressure as well .
pros : it 's like living in an apt .
some of the staff has been friendly in providing things , including shuttle rides .
cons : extremely inconsistent room cleaning service !
the problem is , they do n't show on the assigned day to clean .
we stayed at the shadyside inn for months and spent thousands of dollars .
i really wanted to write a good review , but the experience was disappointing .
the quality of service from the staff was inconsistent .
and the elevator did not work at times .
we will not stay at this hotel again .
i 've never been so horribly treated in my life .
do not stay here .
nothing special about this place .
great location but the facilities are a little tired .
the management at this restaurant is horrendous .
i 've been here twice and i 'm just not crazy about it .
nothing is bad , per se , just not really impressive .
the big green salad was boring and everything was in huge chunks .
they have a hot vegetarian sandwich , but it sounds gross .
i would n't mind coming back for brunch .
she did n't rush us , and made good wine recommendations .
the burger was just a big slab of flavorless ground beef .
i could n't taste salt , pepper , garlic , anything .
their burgers are dead to me .
well , my update has half of my original rating .
i think she got _num_ out of every _num_ drink orders correct .
it was not crowded and we were seated and served promptly .
makes no sense .
worst eggs benedict experience i 've ever had .
additionally , i was not too thrilled with the atmosphere or beer selection .
the fries were fairly soggy and otherwise par for the course .
so tired of this place .
i thought maybe the cook was having a bad night .
the balsamic vinaigrette was straight vinegar .
where do you find apples and feta cheese with no taste ?
butter served with the bread was so hard it bent the knife .
pity .
the bloody mary was completely disgusting .
and there was no alcohol in it .
it was god awful .
it was the same bagel , they just stuck it in the microwave .
had a pretty bad experience last time i went here .
the artichoke dip was ok , but very greasy .
the pasta a bit dry and bland as well .
there is an ok number of beers on tap .
the main courses are very low quality .
honestly , there were _num_ people in the restaurant .
my reuben sandwich was just okay .
probably should have gotten a salad .
i 'm hoping that i just caught them on a bad afternoon .
my lil heart fell .
i do n't know how this place has stayed in business for so long .
the menu is boring .
lettuce was ice cold , nearly frozen .
i hardly ever send food back or complain but this was really bad .
this place is hit or miss .
i 've had good meals here , and i 've had really bad ones .
there 's no pride in the service or the food at all .
sunny only offered a free cleaning and even then seemed annoyed .
could not have been more patronizing .
i would n't recommend richard or the salon to anyone .
the second haircut was great , but styled horribly .
the third haircut was just awful : styled awful , looked strange .
i went into dean of shadyside salon to get my hair colored .
the worst part was checking out .
are you kidding me ?
not pleased with all the hidden costs behind my hair color service .
wo n't be back .
this explains why i got my haircut there so many times .
each visit was more bizarre than the time before .
overall , my haircuts were never good .
and i might add , he knew i was sitting there waiting .
so bad service .
i was their with groupon and they gave me so bad service .
due to 3-4 hours of service i split it into two days .
terrible !
the receptionist can not handle tips at all .
i left extremely upset and no one cared .
terrible customer service !
this is not an exaggeration .
i paid $ _num_ for a partial .
i think i 'll find a place that 's a little more ... me .
overall , haircut & style = _num_ stars .
the towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it !
mani = _num_ star .
the stylist did n't come back after a couple minutes .
when i asked the receptionist where the stylist was , she did n't know .
the next time i returned , i made an appointment with a different stylist .
they did n't even reschedule my appointment with another stylist when she did .
needless to say , i will not be back .
i 've tried to like dean 's several times over the years .
and each time i 've gone , my haircut has been ... .
but the overall vibe is weird and the service sucks .
the technique of the haircut is so poor .
i will not come for the second time .
the service was bad and unfortunately the haircut was even worse .
i tried dean 's because i had a coupon for a free hair cut .
he was very busy working on multiple people at the same time .
i was there for over _num_ hours !
richard does not make you feel comfortable .
i was not impressed with the atmosphere of the salons either .
- i will take my aunt to asians or school in north hills .
it was more than once that i heard glass breaking .
so i might not be the target audience .
the specials and menu prices are apparently wrong .
this is the worst lay out ever for a bar .
pricing is horrendous for beers .
weekend : dont bother .
i have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life .
drink prices are n't anything special and cocktails are n't that strong .
went in there with friends knowing `` friends '' but everyone was rude .
unless you 're a local do n't go in there .
so i 'm not sure how much he 'd approve of this bar .
not a lot of character , but cheap prices .
needless to say , i will never come back here .
i use to pass by this place all the time .
this is a neighborhood denny 's with a bar .
at best , less than mediocre breakfast .
service was slow but they were nice about it .
ca n't comment on food since i was just in for beers .
crappy 's is more like it ... sorry i could not resist !
this place is very below average .
hot sauce was more difficult , took two requests before it came .
the food is basic and inexpensive , you get what you pay for .
so clearly lil off there ... other then that we order common breakfast .
further , they were unapologetic when i complained .
horrible brunch experience .
in my opinion , the is a prime example of a bad shadyside bar .
i 'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible .
this is the worst spot on walnut st !
i 'm not even sure where to start .
the vegetables were n't even cooked .
the food was terrible .
i would rather have eaten a mcdonald 's burger and fries .
overall terrible over priced food experience .
i would recommend never eating here .
so disappointed in food and its cost .
went for brunch and spent $ _num_ .
was n't great .
was there for over _num_ hours because service was so incredibly slow .
it was n't even super busy .
for _num_ girlfriends , they brought _num_ joint check .
then , they are n't even that nice !
rude , crowded , and most importantly not that great !
nothing stood out , including the famous burnt almond torte .
sorry , i grew up in pgh .
the filling in the middle had a bland taste , nothing special about it .
being a pastry chef myself , i had to try it .
i did like that the almonds stayed crispy even through shipping .
i ate one slice , and gave the rest away .
the almond torte used to be the best , hands down .
but , something happened sadly .
the cake part is now dry ?
go back to the way it was done before .
maybe i just got an old cake , i do n't know .
but i 'm really disappointed .
shame on you .
dirty and old looking bakery .
burnt almond torte is not as good as i expected .
not best cake in america by a long shot .
i 've experienced better '' ) because i have .
they were sold out at 2:00 pm on a thursday .
no thanks .
i was given a _num_ dollar gift card .
on top of that the cake was n't even fresh .
the chocolate was too sweet .
horrible service .
i have never been treated so poorly in a cafe .
the service was horrible and their coffee did n't taste great .
this place went from awesome to worst after it changed owners .
they used to have a white mocha but not anymore .
i miss the old owner of the place .
pitiful service .
pamela is a bad representation of this location !
attitude and lack of hygiene is an issue for this `` employee . ''
they frequently mess up my friends orders when we go there .
the toppings on my salad were barely there .
the salad has been greatly reduced in size .
cutting too many corners .
simply gross .
i should have looked or felt it before i left the store .
( all same kind of cookie ) .
apparently old cookies are standard here .
service is actually friendly , but slow , and all the employees are weird .
and the store is dirty , just as others have said .
avoid until this store gets its act together .
the district manager of this bakery to make sure it does not happen again .
that exchange was awkward too .
it is absurd !
these people are very unprofessional and rude .
my main complaint with them is that they lied to me .
one of worst patient experiences .
his staff is embarrassed .
will not go back there , ever !
did n't havana go out of biz ?
if not , oops !
i only go in to buy six packs .
she was rude and all over the place .
hummus is ridiculously expensive .
juice is cheap .
every time we go here , we come out highly stressed , which sucks .
drama , drama , and more drama .
the entrance to this location always smells like spoiled milk .
so incredibly frustrating !
not bad after hours but those hours are pretty narrow .
i woke up with a stuffy nose and in need of some hot soup .
this time it was runny bland mushy rice with extra mushy veggies .
gross !
plus i did n't feel great !
the small package was _num_ dollars .
selection of veggies are ok .
selection of fruit is a little below average .
however , lately i 'm becoming more and more frustrated by the store .
this is my third grocery store stop of the day .
for anyone who uses self checkout at this store do not forget your bags !
`` again i ask oh really is there nothing you can do ? ''
`` no i am sorry nothing we can do . ''
but going here is always such a nightmare .
the parking lot is miserable .
the aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size .
the romaine is especially pitiful .
it 's come to the point that i avoid this place if i can .
i do n't care for this giant eagle , and that is being kind .
wo n't be back .
items do n't have price tags .
that 's the only reason why i gave them such a poor mark .
none of that .
same goes for milk , cold cuts and breakfast meat products .
they also have fake sales .
instead of about _num_ '' _num_ '' it 's about _num_ '' thick .
i went there for a few grocery items along with some alcoholic beverages .
the only thing that saved this store were the nice people that worked there .
this giant eagle market district is garbage .
the cashiers , pharmacy , and customer service manager were so rude and stupid .
_num_ hours to find the cold remedy i wanted .
but why support a business that really does n't care about you .
the `` customer '' service and pharmacy are terrible at this location !
i checked out as quickly as possible and nearly ran out of the store .
after _num_ years i 'd hoped they would have improved but i was wrong .
guess not .
i mean , i understand you do n't care about _num_ dollars .
i never really understood why doc 's was so popular .
i personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck .
the drinks are weak as well .
entrees were half off but all looked mediocre .
big groups of patrons led to pretty slow service .
the beer selection is n't that great and the upstairs bar is not full .
the service can also be rather slow .
cheese fries , burgers , some salads , mediocre pasta , etc .
my feet were still rough .
to be smooth after only one pedicure . ''
excuse me ?
it was horrible .
ignoring the fact that i was unhappy and i did n't like it .
she just kept trying to cover her ass instead of listening to my concerns .
the front desk girls were not friendly or helpful as well .
it 's an embarrassment on walnut .
if i wanted them in _num_ days i would have paid $ _num_ less !
no such luck , they said they were not able to do that .
and you just lost all of our business .
disgusting .
does n't even deserve one star !
however , the customer service here is absolutely awful .
tiffany prices with kay jewelers selection .
unfortunately within _num_ days one of the diamonds on the halo was missing .
i 'm sure that this is a fluke and will be taken care of .
however , this past visit was unfortunate .
the host was horrendous and extremely rude .
we were disappointed .
we mention our reservation , he says no problem _num_ min ... great !
okay , i know what you 're thinking why not just leave ?
i 've already admitted it 's nothing special .
but also way over prices .
really disappointing .
service is bad when you enter .
if it is busy expect to be treated poorly .
that will be ignored and you will wait like everyone else .
the food is poor .
the pasta was mushy -- way overcooked .
far too much cream and cheese .
did n't finish this dish .
my wife had a chicken special .
boring .
bland .
overall :
although there were some highlights , there were plenty of negatives to counter them .
not a good start .
disappointing .
not a good start .
very poor form on the owners part .
but when the bill came there was none of that .
i then turned around and walked out .
i have never been treated so badly as a consumer .
actually i will make sure to spread the word of this terrible experience .
and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes .
this was the most absurd display at a restaurant i have ever seen .
food was excellent but we hated the ambiance !
reservations at 7:00 pm saturday .
i guess that 's what they say to excuse the lack of proper a/c .
that completely turned us away from this restaurant .
very rude and unacceptable .
never going back .
ravioli , chicken breast , sauteed greens and a seasoned broth .
while the greens were decent , there were barely enough for a few bites .
we made the unfortunate decision to make a reservation here for a special occasion .
i wo n't be going here again .
luckily we had a fabulous dinner at another restaurant instead .
the owner has a complete disregard for customers and the customer experience .
we submitted our name thinking it would be 20-30 mins .
as tables became available he would seat groups that he knew and/or had reservations .
my friends had left this woman at least a _num_ % tip .
that is the prime reason why i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone .
the restaurant never called us , so we ended up eating elsewhere .
this time we literally got sat at a table in the kitchen hallway .
they should be serving free meals to anyone they stick at that table .
what a horrible experience !
it then took another _num_ minutes to get wine glasses .
this made everyone extremely uncomfortable !
the old guy continued to drink wine and yelled at another waitress .
so be aware they added an automatic _num_ % gratuity to the check .
life is too short to waste you time and money on this place !
very poor management .
very stupid management .
they do n't know how to do business .
they do n't help you to find a table .
come for the food and not the atmosphere or service .
i made reservations for _num_ pm on a friday .
the waitress who seemed to be rushed did not offer any recommendations .
aside from the poor service and chaos , the food was pretty good .
also , i was surprised by the limited number of seafood options .
the menu states there are _num_ market priced items .
prices were not listed on that daily special menu sheet either .
as dinner was my treat , i felt very awkward asking for prices .
note that risotto , the only entree with a price , is $ _num_ .
the beef turns out to be $ _num_ .
i personally would not go back , even though the food was fantastic .
treated badly .
the owner gave that table to a local group who showed up after us .
basically , reservations mean nothing here .
even if the food is great , the customer service is terrible .
unfortunately , the party stops there .
the main courses are extremely overpriced ( not unusual for walnut st. ) .
apparently it was a list of people that needed to be seated .
my husband and i left and i said we would n't be coming back .
so extremely rude .
can not justify giving money to someone who runs their business in that manner .
really though someone had to have messed up my dish .
deserts were nothing less than stellar , and the service was awesome .
i was shocked by how bad our experience was considering the other reviews .
the food was decently made and the environment was welcoming .
she said it was salty but the pasta was bland .
she took my bottle of wine and did not mention the price or anything .
most restaurants charge per bottle , not per person .
i may or may not come back .
not off to a good start .
i will not be coming back .
overall not impressed .
so bland .
_num_ stars .
decor leaves much to be desired .
_num_ star .
fifteen minutes later , the waitress returned , but not with our food .
by this time , i was through with this place .
based on my experience , i wo n't be returning anytime soon .
i got the beef , the chicken & cilantro and the spinach empanadas .
do n't get me wrong , i wanted to like this place .
with all that said we tried all _num_ flavors of the empanadas they offered .
i ca n't even understand how people came to that conclusion .
the empty cup is still in front of me though .
i 've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced .
i will never go back though .
not worth the hassle anymore & do a poor job .
way too expensive if you ask me .
it is such a rip off .
find someplace else in bloomfield .
is n't that why we bring clothes to the cleaners in the first place ?
they were returned to me a full size smaller than i dropped them off .
not very complicated .
also they lost my fianc 's work shirts .
will not be returning .
it was returned with a hole in back of suit jacket .
sorry to say that will be my last visit .
if someone had been standing there , this would have caused serious injury .
i just ca n't imagine having to deal with this a year .
the minus : the maintenance staff is always around .
their staff is horribly rude that way .
thus , it makes me sad to write a negative review .
they are completely mean and disrespectful .
ps the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve _num_ stars !
horrible in every sense of the word .
terrible !
it took _num_ months for them to resolve this situation .
at one point , they even asked me not to use the shower .
a year later , the ceiling in my bedroom began to leak .
i used my apartment as essentially a storage unit until my lease expired .
i have never in my life seen anything like it .
they do n't c are .
horrible !
they wo n't even bother to tell you that they will come !
not worth your money .
find a better management who does n't take your money and piss on you .
bathroom leaks atleast _num_ times a month .
very common problem in these apartments .
cant wait to move on .
the rent is too damn high .
if you sign a lease now it 's $ _num_ .
the hallways smell like hot garbage , always .
i was towed within _num_ hours after parking back there at ( 10pm ) .
( no where on the contract does it state that ! )
bingo , could n't have said it better .
it is not worth it .
they just broke into my house without any notice to show around .
then , before i was able to say anything , they broke in .
ridiculous .
i had no disclosure of this whatsoever when i signed my lease .
i do n't even understand how they have the time for this .
it 's absolutely disgusting , and you get no peace whatsoever .
now , i am stuck due to the heavy fees it would cost .
i 'm truly not out to get anyone with writing a negative review .
management did not even apologize for my inconvenience .
i thought this was way too much .
this was my big mistake .
, but instead they decided to take advantage of my position .
i do n't know .
they did not fix the building by the way .
also , my package was stolen twice .
they refuse to put a camera in the package room , parking lot too .
overall the rent keeps going up every year and their service just getting worse .
first of all , and the most important thing , they are not honest .
you pay fees , they make laundry and garbage more and more inconvenient .
elevator always has problems .
they do n't respect your privacy at all .
management said there was nothing they could do about it .
they 're all around rude to deal with .
wondered into this place looking for some mixed drinks .
but too much pamela 's seems greasy .
however , the pricing really is low when you 're lazy .
on top of it all , the coffee was horrible .
it looked like someone 's basement or garage with tables in it .
it 's like breakfast at most any other diner .
if you are dragged here by your friends , find new friends .
two words : grossly overrated .
unfortunately , pamela 's is neither of these things .
sadly , i walked away from my meal with a `` meh '' feeling .
first off , i kept hearing about these pancakes i got ta try .
they were super buttery ... too much so .
too bad .
ca n't beat it .
we had a terrible breakfast here not long ago .
plus the bread was poor quality .
the crepe pancakes were ok , but nothing to write home about .
we 'll be enjoying breakfast elsewhere in the future .
for pamela 's , we gave it a shot .
the restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables .
way too rich to finish .
not deserving of the rave reviews .
breakfast is cheap , and definitely very poor quality .
the waitresses were extremely fast , except for coffee refills .
that is a huge turn off , especially if you are out of town .
this place is n't worth going to an atm for .
they are super thin and crispy on the outside .
i also did n't love the service we received .
there are a few of them and there 's really nowhere else to go .
it 's sad .
this was just a joke and definitely not worth the wait .
we went on a sunday and i expected a wait , which was fine .
they were busy , but our waitress was slightly cold and barely around .
this was one of the most disappointing food experiences i 've had in pittsburgh .
it was average , but not restaurant quality .
the only thing that made it somewhat decent was sour cream and guacamole .
i ate about _num_ bites and left the rest .
it was n't worth even trying to eat for absolutely zero taste .
needless to say , we wo n't be going back for quite some time !
and , most sadly , the cup of coffee was weak .
not keeping with the the _num_ star yelp review that brought us here .
done in less than _num_ hours .
come now , i barely drink alcohol .
granted , i like to host social events .
however , i never ever will let a social event get out of control .
so here comes the story of walnut capital .
they complained that our house was not clean and scared off the potential tenants .
but we never let the house get to a point of disaster .
we always took the trash out .
never again will i rent from this company .
- chuck the driver for the shuttle is cool .
under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order .
so , my wife got up and we walked out of this place .
in fact , i did n't eat anything at all .
the restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of walnut street .
first , there are n't many tables .
my party and i left to go to another restaurant .
however , the crepes are extremely over price .
so over price that i can not afford a drink .
i 've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff .
the savory crepes were better than the sweet crepes which were a disappointment .
but it was the attitude of the owner that turned me off the establishment .
we were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours .
the prices on the menu do n't seem that bad .
but i still cant get over the fact there closed on mondays .
that aside , the crepes are okay , nothing special .
the other thing i do not like about this place are their hours .
i looked at my boyfriend who checked his watch while i checked my iphone .
otherwise , negative stars would be in effect .
who on earth could possibly find this place worth returning to ?
what a completely miserable experience .
even the orange juice was bad .
the response and reaction that i got from her receptionist was quite rude .
i made an appointment weeks ago .
i said i could n't .
just totally inconsiderate .
they refuse to put anything on paper .
every thing about this place is wrong .
i should not be responsible for the bill .
they did not explain this to me when i register .
this place is the worst ever .
beware !
when we arrived there , however it was a different story .
we shrugged it off and went to the bar .
terrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place .
just getting off work , i came alone .
the walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass .
neither of us were surprised .
the food handling left much to be desired .
this was sorely lacking .
first thing i realized is that there 's no bathroom in the room .
since we were staying one night , this was a major disappointment .
the wedding manager nicole is ok , but nothing special .
it is clear that this is not her main priority .
not professional at all .
not a huge deal , but annoying since we asked them to do that .
unfortunately , it appears to be very poorly managed .
they were not met here .
that is not what you want to hear first thing in the morning !
there were no pictures hung in the room to improve the appearance .
the costumer service really ruined my experience .
awful customer service , rude and poorly managed .
it was not even $ _num_ including se day shipping !
the location also seemed a bit sketchy ; i 'd avoid this one .
try panera bread across the street .
we ai n't got no hashbrowns !
employees show no sense of urgency .
if any of the employees would smile i would die from shock .
do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?
do n't use the drive-thru .
but i quickly learned my lesson .
i got tired of spending _num_ minutes of my lunch break waiting in line .
no less than _num_ minutes .
the drive-thru is only slightly faster at 10-15 mins .
plus , the staff is rude .
big corporate america places only get one shot w us .
swing and miss .
worst wait times ever , staff is inefficient .
the drive thru line is always too long and moves too slowly .
also , the service is slow and poor .
worst wendy 's i have ever had .
i suppose , then , i should n't have been surprised by the food .
my moo shu chicken was mostly cabbage .
the food here was greasy , uninspired and bland .
i was also disappointed that they do n't serve brown rice .
not to be recommended unless you 're desperate .
i had to throw it in the microwave because it was no longer hot .
and they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in . )
we used to visit this place most every time we went to pittsburgh .
the food is n't terrible , either , but it 's not great .
oh , and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all .
dim lighting that makes me want to sleep .
it 's not romantic , just dim .
the only waitress i 've had there is pretty rude .
my minimum tip is $ _num_ , even at the cheapest places .
the food is only okay .
i am never going to order their general tso ever again .
never ever whatsoever !
price is not bad .
why is it so hard to find a good chinese restaurant in pittsburgh ?
not all her fault .
not bad , a little tasteless , but why bother ?
nor good signs and we should have walked out then .
the worst chinese food i 've had .
there were bugs in my egg drop soup .
i ordered two orders of soup hot and sour and egg drop .
i only eat the hot and sour the night we ordered our take out .
looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup .
disgusting .
the wonton soup was watery , and the wontons were inedible .
not very good chinese food here .
it reminded me of a cheap college place .
they give you plenty of food but it is low quality .
the rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy `` pork '' .
it tasted nothing like pork , or meat for that matter .
the soup was a weird creamy mess .
wrong .
cardboard .
cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster .
it was just awful and the service was terrible .
i looked around and there were only _num_ other people in the entire restaurant .
is n't that what they 're supposed to do ?
anyway , the food was not very good .
in fact , it was awful .
i 'm not sure they were .
there 's never any reason to be rude to your patrons .
no need to ever return .
after an hour of waiting , i called to check on our order .
i asked if it was out for delivery and she could n't tell me .
she could n't tell me how much longer we would wait .
the delivery driver arrived about _num_ minutes later .
horrible .
crappy service and food .
could not eat it .
waiter clearly did not know what he was talking about .
there are better chinese places on pittsburgh - this place should be shut down !
there is nothing chinese about the food !
general tso chicken lacks in chicken .
terrible service .
our food was cold .
i spent $ _num_ and only ate the fortune cookie .
did n't know you could mess up chicken lo mein .
delivery came somewhat cold , extremely bland .
very disappointed .
the service provided by a chinese man was terrible !
and the food was terrible too !
worst chinese food ever .
it 's either just decent , or just plain bad .
i 'm still trying to figure out how one manages to burn noodles .
this place is disgusting .
worst chinese food i 've ever had .
it tasted rotten and disgusting .
i picked out the broccoli and ate it over my side of rice .
worst chinese food i 've had in ages .
we ordered just soup and eggrolls for takeout .
the worst ever chinese restaurant if we can call this place as restaurant !
future actions : will not come again for sure !
at this point , one star is being generous .
after a noticeable drop in quality , i started ordering elsewhere .
my girlfriend ordered sesame chicken and it tasted like fish .
i had chicken and broccoli with limp foul tasting broccoli .
unfortunately , we threw out most of our entrees .
i will not be ordering here ever again .
i think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside .
_num_ woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable .
i have n't received my piece yet and its been about _num_ days .
everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality .
too pricey for the quality .
while it has a somewhat trendy looking menu , do n't be fooled .
while the onion soup was actually good , the rest was awful .
service was horrible .
very slow .
food was mediocre .
crab cakes were awful .
worse than eat park quality .
just said to try back again !
completely disappointing .
not too shabby .
salads , sandwiches , burgers and entrees we have all had before .
i had the walnut crusted salmon sandwich and jordan had the reuben .
french fries are pretty standard .
the food is lousy .
what a disappointment - i wo n't be back .
the service in this store is ridiculous .
why could n't they take a couple minutes and wrap our gift for us ?
i was so confused and annoyed that i just left after paying .
they just are n't nice .
the manager wears face earrings , how very unprofessional .
sure she knew that rude .
the place is dirty too .
delivery time was unimpressive .
that 's what i get for being lazy , probably .
otherwise , probably not .
man were they wrong !
we ordered a large steak stromboli with extra cheese through grub hub .
not even worth a star .
the hot wings i ordered came as plain breaded wings .
it was one of the worst pizzas i 've ever had .
first of all , the pie had almost no real flavor .
the dough , sauce , cheese ... even the pepperoni was bland .
i put some hot sauce on it strictly to add flavor .
on top of it , i got so sick .
my stomach was in knots for hours .
very cheap over breaded and not fresh at all .
the good : the ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful .
if it were n't so convenient i doubt i 'd go back .
my big issue is that the employees stand directly outside and smoke .
i get the location is close but it is not worth the grief .
i called two more times after this with no call back .
i would n't recommend going here .
there were _num_ customers ahead of me and _num_ ladies behind the counter .
i also plan to tell my family and friends not to shop here .
terrible service .
extremely rude lady works there on sundays .
the worst bakery i ever shopped in !
if given the chance again i would n't have another party here .
very cold to watch a game in even buy usual local rink standards .
made the same mistake 2x by going to these clowns .
could n't even call me to let me know .
drove down there so they could say sorry want to do it tomorrow ?
they 'll try to hit you with a bunch of unnecessary repairs .
do n't waste your time with this place .
just this last episode that has to deal with an inspection has me annoyed !
i have driven _num_ miles in the car since beginning of september .
so after explaining the situation they lower the price to $ _num_ .
not a bad place to look around while waiting for your order .
_num_ which seems to be a never ending construction zone .
the pizza was really greasy , and the bacon was minimal .
avoid .
worst nail salon ever .
not a smart move on my part .
the place was totally dusty and there was no ac .
i just kinda stared at her in shock , unable to speak .
it was just a bad scene .
it 'll never dry !
i would absolutely not return to this salon .
this made me question whether or not she was professionally trained .
what a complete waste .
i had a mani pedi today and they were brutal ... .
so painful !
the owner was sitting right there and did n't do anything or say anything .
please know that i hate leaving bad reviews .
and the pedicure was really really painful !
i would like to stress again though that my feet look awesome .
but i left stressed and bleeding !
i do n't know whats worse , terrible service or this filthy venue .
no wonder it is for sale .
do not get married here !
i would not suggest this bar to anyone .
we went here for easter buffet and the money it was not worth it .
the food was tasteless , place looked dirty , and rude waitress .
this place seems to have gone downhill since last time .
sorry , i gotten very used to no smoking i public places in pittsburgh .
ash trays all over the bar .
if i could give signature desserts _num_ stars , i would .
linda did not call .
this was the worst experience i ever had with business owners !
nothing was the way i ordered it !
i ca n't even begin to tell you how they treated me !
steve and linda were so rude and unprofessional !
just called to get information for my son 's birthday cake .
either way , no need for rudeness .
i bought pastries at this place several times before .
this place is run by korean women who are interested in providing extra services .
$ _num_ wasted because i never got my massage .
avoid this place unless you are looking for the happy ending .
had n't been here for several years , horrible disappointment .
egg rolls , wonton soup were not good .
i visited here at 6:30 p.m. on a saturday night .
there are about _num_ seating options , _num_ were used all the others empty .
first sign i chose to ignore .
nothing updated , nothing new , nothing fresh .
second sign i chose to ignore .
he was loud , very loud .
he was not asian .
white , and very loud .
there was no asian table or house workers in the front side of things .
third sign i chose to ignore .
nothing special in flavor or presentation .
perhaps leftovers from the _num_ steakhouse sale .
i sent all the food back shortly into the meal because it was cold .
when was the last time you ate chinese food that was cold ?
it 's never cold , never .
the tree died .
the salesperson walked away and proceed to start helping other customers .
after waiting for 5-10 minutes , she went back to the sales person .
she paid top dollar for the tree because she believed it was guaranteed .
she received neither .
the service was poor .
unfortunately the food was a let down .
my daughter ordered the fettuccine alfredo and it was quite bland .
the lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude .
will not use this garage in the future .
sounded like i was flying a helicopter .
they just came up with some excuse .
careless workmanship is all you 'll find here .
i had a bad experience at penn automotive .
second , the lady at the counter is extremely rude and unpleasant .
i could have spoken to him in _num_ minutes and gotten out of there .
these folks are not honest and just want you out of there quickly .
have never experience such a rude interaction with a car shop .
this place has gone down hill fast !
the staff makes it feels like you are bothering them when you order .
and _num_ % of the time your order is wrong .
the drive thru is flat out dangerous .
cold food ?
try to avoid this location .
this is nothing new .
this has always been my least favorite wendy 's .
ugh .
the prices are downright insulting .
is that too much to ask ?
for a store the size of giant eagle , i expect more .
third , i 've personally had issues with meat quality here .
the first time , i thought maybe i just got a bad batch .
fool me -- you ca n't get fooled again . ''
lastly , i 've had some really poor customer service experiences at this location .
it 's annoying , i get it .
but my hubby did n't know any better .
but kayla , our cashier ?
completely unacceptable !
all right , now i 'm really done .
i 've eaten here several times and they are not very flexible .
they did n't .
they gave me another burnt sandwich .
worst customer service ever at the pharmacy here .
ridiculous .
avoid at all costs -- inefficient beyond belief .
i will not be back .
tonight is the last time i use this giant eagle pharmacy .
these people are the worst .
i get there only to find out they have nothing ready .
from there , it takes them another _num_ minutes to fill one prescription .
thank you for wasting my time , i wo n't be back .
why every time i come in here , it 's really hot ?
why every time i come in here , it 's really hot ?
better than subway , but not jimmy johns .
this place does not accept credit cards in the year _num_ .
overall just a really bad experience .
not sure about the food handling practices here .
tasted very good , but i was disappointed in how dirty this place is .
very rude staff .
i heard her talking about customers very badly .
i do n't mind them being cash only .
i do n't mind the unpleasant cashiers .
i 'm begging you .
i would n't wish this place on my own worst enemy .
i would n't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend .
he was very kind , but only dropped my food off .
the menu says there 's a charge for fried rice instead of white .
jimmy wan 's offers white and brown , no extra charge .
the atmosphere was atrocious .
the waitstaff saw what was happening and did n't care at all .
how were _num_ people in the _num_ seat restaurant and one small takeout order .
wan 's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with _num_ other friends .
he called me to pick him up as i was paying the bill .
the rest of the food was awful .
it was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager .
they were again completely flavorless , but warmer .
i could n't taste salt or pepper or garlic or even feel any heat .
it was awful .
i hated this food and this experience .
the staff was rude .
i closed the door and she walked away .
that was insanely rude .
this place is just not what it used to be .
this is the worst chinese food i 've ever had in pittsburgh .
honestly , it 's probably the worst i 've ever had .
i expected at least decent and i was extremely disappointed .
this place barely uses any flavor other than salt and msg .
unfortunately i heard after i ordered .
we were so excited to try this after all the hype .
last night we ordered take out and it left us disappointed .
mine needed a bit more sauce to make not as dry .
i 'm just not that excited for my lunch .
there 's not much left to say .
got chicken with string beans ( $ _num_ ) take-out .
the chicken was slimy and not many pieces at that .
this dish was smothered in sauce and had no flavor .
i will not order anything from this place ever again .
go to sesame inn in north hills and other locations .
i 'm not sure its all made in-house anymore .
moo shu has plenty of cabbage , hardly any meat .
paid $ _num_ for three early bird specials - all three were beef broccoli .
food is adequate but service leaves something to be desired .
after a lengthy wait we ended up sitting at separate tables .
delivery was fast but the food was terrible !
the egg roll was soggy and cold .
also , very expensive !
total for the above was $ _num_ !
hand me my order and cash me out ! )
we ordered spider sushi rolls , hawaiian chicken , and general tso chicken .
unfortunately the atmosphere did n't make up for the sub par food .
i 've had way better chinese sushi at giant eagle of all places .
it turned into a giant mess .
not sure we will be back .
i was sick to my stomach when i left .
the one rabbit is ( per statement vet ) not going to get better .
yet , he still drew blood and several yelled codes to the techs .
money trouble ?
because i 'm not prepared to pay $ _num_ for a single visit ?
my cat is not eating .
thanks , but no .
replied `` uh , it has to be printed '' .
actually , there are not `` two sizes '' of `` one scoop '' .
pretty disappointed in my service here the other day .
_num_ minutes of discussion for $ _num_ worth of food ?
so rude .
but my patience was not even worth it .
somewhat disappointed would best be the title for my review .
upon arriving i immediately did n't feel welcome .
it tasted like hot chocolate .
things like that really bother me .
bottom line : not terrible , but very underwhelmed by the coffee and service .
this place is dirty and the coffee is horrible .
ok i said i was sorry .
number of other guests is often zero - uncomfortable .
first and far most people , i never write a bad review .
actually , this is n't even a bad review .
the pad thai was not good and that 's what it should be !
i do n't care how many awards they have hanging on they wall .
just not going back there .
who cares what i think though , everyone has a different taste .
i have n't been here in a long time .
i should 've known better .
the waitress just was too young and inexperienced .
this visit was n't horrible , but definitely kinda unpleasant .
( seriously , i feel sorry for someone truly fat going in there ) .
um , not me , thanks .
truly , if at all possible , avoid her !
i 'm nothing if not organized .
but i already had a bad taste in my mouth .
it 's really too bad because as i said , her collection looks lovely .
but for those considering a long distance purchase , just beware a bit .
worst venue iv been to .
big mistake .
but it was n't during peak hours .
as noted by other posters the waitress was the bartender .
smoky , but not horribly so .
not sure why it would be featured on the show .
i get the same meal constantly and pay different prices everytime .
owner is rude & does n't handle customers well .
i will never place an order for me & my coworkers again .
terrible service , rude staff .
avoid this place .
while it was ok , it was n't great .
i wo n't be back .
ordered a glass of wine and beers for my companions .
sent one of my companions to get me some water .
they were frozen and certainly not worth the price .
the garbage and mail are very inconvenient .
it is just way too expensive to live like in a trailer park .
this place is terrible .
i am giving it _num_ stars only because the manager was nice .
the food was even worse than i remembered .
it was so spicy i could n't really taste anything .
and it was very annoying !
she did n't refill drinks .
the food was lukewarm when it arrived at the table .
my salad was missing _num_ items that were supposed to be on the salad .
not very appetizing .
asked for a manager , she never came to the table .
bad night ?
not sure and we wo n't be back to find out .
like two weeks ago when i stayed here for three days ?
you get off the elevator on the 5th floor .
bathrooms way too small i had to dry off outside the bathroom .
they really are the only thing this place has going for it .
luckily , it was n't an issue for me to move .
not so great ?
the hotel subs out the services for the business office .
not a good idea .
one of the people working said that was probably because of `` renovations . ''
the elevator moved really slow .
i think they probably deserve better .
the restaurant was worse for breakfast .
there were tables and servers ?
bad planning and execution ?
this school is a terrible deal for what you pay .
i do not support this unethical business practice .
i would give carolina auto repair no stars if possible .
i can not eat salad so ordered the soup .
turns out they do n't have soup .
turns out they do n't have mixed vegetables which is on the menu .
so instead of the rice i ordered a baked potato .
we got garlic bread which was too thick and not enough butter .
do n't waste your time or money .
my salad had a rotten tomato and a hair ( not mine ) .
the broiled flounder was n't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies .
both were so bland i could have prepared a better version at home .
my mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre .
i 'm sure they do but i had to spit mine out .
this particular location is horrible .
avoid !
avoid !
after _num_ minutes without getting closer to the register , i gave up .
this used to be my favorite local waffle house .
i walked in and was a little surprised .
_num_ separate different roaches in a matter of _num_ minutes in the same restaurant .
i will never be back .
the front waiting area was in mass confusion .
this is not an acceptable response for management .
this pizza hut is not a top choice , but ok in a pinch .
i had my _num_ year old with me and i 'm _num_ weeks pregnant .
we were starving waiting on our food .
another _num_ minutes pass and we finally got our order .
i live _num_ minutes from their location .
service was horrible !
not to mention , our order was wrong !
avoid at all costs ... .
this place is way over priced .
fired oysters and scallops over $ _num_ here .
if you use a teller you get charged $ _num_ for the month .
the food was awful .
but they do n't even seem to have subs .
tables were dirty .
well ok i guess .
the building is old and dirty .
never going back .
not one good thing to say .
so our entire meal that day ended up in the trash .
i was n't able to find the _num_ lb .
ball within the already limited selection .
food is limited and all fried , that 's not a good thing either .
i only give it _num_ stars because of the wait staff !
it is ridiculous !
they need to find new wait staff who are attentive and friendly !
does zero good to complain .
obvious they could care less .
worst mcdonalds in the united states of america .
i could get food faster in a prison cell .
most fast food places fall in the the meh category for me .
the employees did not seem to care and had no sense to work faster .
avoid !
and a lot has changed for the worst unfortunately .
horrible !
not to mention they do n't fill your drink !
the gun shot great , unfortunately the staff and facilities were well below par .
i have spent a lot of time at shooting ranges both indoors and out .
i will not be a repeat patron .
he warned me about this place ... should have taken his advice .
rude , disrespectful jerks who should not be dealing with the public .
like i said , i wo n't be back .
we did n't , as this was our first visit .
the range itself had terrible ventilation .
sweating at the lanes while trying to hold a loaded gun .
no bueno .
the lighting was poor .
my biggest complaint is pricing .
$ _num_ per hour per person ... with an one hour minimum .
most indoor ranges charge by lane , not person .
customer service was poor and unfriendly .
the bathroom was gross .
they will not get another dime of mine .
same guy , same attitude .
if you 're desperate for chinese , get it to go .
went a few times and the last visit made me sick .
i was very disappointed with new china .
we got the curry chicken , beef with broccoli , and crab rangoons .
i would highly encourage others to go elsewhere .
i will not return to new china .
the staff is rude and store is usually very dirty .
get your wallet ready , the prices are crazy high !
nothing to brag about .
but last night it took _num_ hrs to get a burger .
management did n't even come by table to apologize about the wait .
here for trivia night on tuesday night .
good food but this is ridiculous .
they need to get some help in here or people will stop coming !
the hollandaise sauce was sour and had a horrible vinegar taste to it .
just had the worst experience at a nail salon .
so i did n't pay for the white .
absolute worst experience at a nail salon .
my acrylics now look like crap , and i have cuts on my cuticles .
my friend 's nails looked like a _num_ year old did them .
this was the worst gel manicure experience i 've had .
all the techs are nice except the man ( andy ) he is horrible !
he can not get the shape right to save his life .
my acrylic nails are crooked and shorter than i asked .
on top of that he is very rude and has no customer service skills .
i have left bleeding twice .
the staff 's attitude is straight out of the big apple .
we did n't have a problem taking it to go .
would n't recommend going out of your way for a slice .
what happened ?
hoping it 's just been a bad few nights .
but last few times i have gone it has not taste the same .
crust not cooked enough etc i hope this is not a trend .
parking is atrocious .
however i was n't treated well and i wo n't go back .
just awful customer service .
we were disappointed .
firstly , this place used to be free to the public .
but this was our first visit , and we wo n't be back .
it looked like they had not worked on this field in many months .
also had to dodge many foul balls .
okay , so maybe that night we just had bad luck ?
our greeting at the front desk was awful .
she was appalling and rude .
another $ _num_ .
very sad that there are people out there taking advantage of per owners .
this is on a weekend ( saturday night - sunday morning ) .
as a customer i really do n't care .
i 'm glad this place is for emergency service only ( for us ) .
when the tech returned with my dog she did n't say a word .
alot of money for very poor care .
i will not be going back .
this pizza is mediocre at best .
no thank you .
i got a medium _num_ topping and this pizza was very bland to me .
from my first bite it was missing something ... flavor .
wo n't be going back .
the pizza is very soggy and the salad is brown and mostly inedible .
they ripped me off .
i paid over $ _num_ for _num_ large cheese pizzas .
they do n't even have a restroom for customers !
this is the burger king that corporate forgot .
king nasty !
just awful .
the last time that we went there he had our car for over week .
we called again and he said that they could n't find our car keys .
i have n't use their service yet .
i stopped by to see them , asking them to give me a price .
i gave them all my contacts information to reach me .
they seems not care to lose a customer , it is disappointing .
no return call either .
do n't bother .
i wish i could give less stars .
i told her that was no problem .
she not only lost out on a past customer .
owner on the phone and did n't even acknowledge the customer .
food was awful .
szechuan beef tasted like ketchup .
it is too bad i ca n't give this zero stars .
i had kung pao chicken and got really bad food poisoning .
the chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful .
food was terrible and woman who rang me up was soooooo rude .
chicken chewy and rubbery .
last two years have noticed quality of food sadly going down .
couple of years ago more orders were found to be overcooked and less meaty .
i brought my order home , found three pieces of chicken , overcooked .
sorry panda ; this loyal customer has had enough .
it was indeed pretty horrible even for $ _num_ per medium .
do not go for the pumpkin patch !
it 's really sad actually .
the installers were knowledgeable , friendly and efficient .
my main issue is that i did not receive what i paid for .
very poor customer service , and that 's too bad .
so frustrated .
i just do n't know how a business in _num_ can operate this way .
them stood behind some policy that they could n't sell parts .
they came out on a sunday which is much appreciated .
one week later it was empty again .
i wasted $ _num_ for nothing because they did n't do a through job .
i booked this hotel stay for a business ( military ) event .
we booked a total of _num_ rooms with them and checked in individually .
i was a little dissatisfied in how poorly i welcomed to the hotel .
the cable and internet did not work our first night there .
the room had a musty smell to it .
it was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express .
the parking situation is horrible .
she did not greet me as i opened the door .
she did , however , return quickly with a hair dryer .
most of the staff were borderline rude or down right rude .
the breakfast area was incredibly crowded .
the morning of checkout my bill had not been placed under the door .
worst service in the area , by far .
i have eaten at this restaurant before and the service was n't so bad .
food was ok , nothing much to speak of .
he said that he could not take it and referred me to the manager .
they said if i printed it out , i could have used it .
he did not understand and said , no coupon .
none of the regulars were there .
do n't waste your time coming to this hole in the wall !
made me walk across the floor after my pedi w bare feet .
i looked down and saw dirty toe nails and finger nails on the floor .
gross !
worse nail salon i 've ever experienced .
nails looked nice but only lasted about _num_ and a half days .
no heavy lifting no reason for my nails to be breaking left and right .
do not waste your time or money there , you will regret it .
unfortunately , that did n't happen .
when i walked in i gave them my name and paid for my order .
but then i had to wait more than _num_ minutes to get my food .
unacceptable .
if i had not already paid for the food , i would have left .
my sandwich did n't even have true tomato slices .
just chunks of tomato .
this was such a sour experience .
i wo n't be back .
we got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries .
save your money on the chili cheese fries .
and cheese sauce that you get for your nachos at the gas station .
i have been here a total of four times .
sure enough , a few minutes later it was on my table .
the portions here are huge ( the one constant ) .
next week i happily tried to repeat the last order i got .
ended up just getting plain strips with honey mustard on the side .
drinks are far too expensive to try any .
the wings and cheese fries were disgusting .
do n't recommend buying a car of another make here .
only after the third time returning did anyone apologize .
so fool me once , shame on me .
i consider it a blessing that it did n't work out .
very rude service was in line for ten mins .
most places charge _num_ to _num_ dollars .
i thought it was from a sloppy oil change .
so much for trying to support local business .
it 's not .
holly on the way to _num_ .
every order is wrong .
too bad even then the orders are not right .
what 's worse ?
nothing changes even when they are n't busy .
avoid this location .
most time i wait so long i end up going inside .
the cheapest thing on the menu was $ _num_ .
when it was time to get up the breakfast food was bad .
they charge for internet service in the room , that 's so _num_ !
but it 's not good for longer stays or repeat visits .
half of the floors do n't have vending machines .
one of the floors that does does not offer drinks .
internet access is $ _num_ per day .
it 's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable .
answer : pretty bad !
it was a tired person 's worst nightmare .
i 'd say , skip this one .
we booked this hotel to stay during an overnight layover in charlotte .
that 's just nasty !
so i went through the whole thing for nothing .
there are no decent food options within walking distance .
the beds are very comfortable so you can get a good night 's sleep .
however , as a guest , i would not go back .
she did n't offer any ideas for help and was quite frankly , rude .
i had the same problem on my laptop , ipad and iphone .
it was n't me .
others in our group had problems as well .
not convenient for an early flight .
this hotel is really dated , and the rooms smell funny .
night manager tried to enter my room at _num_ am while i was sleeping .
my sleep and stay was ruined .
i 've contacted the hotel manager twice and have received no response from her .
the hotel itself is ok .
the bed was comfortable enough and the room was mostly clean .
it looks like they do n't vacuum very often .
the room i had was bland , one piece of ugly artwork .
open closet reminiscent of a motel _num_ .
it was clean , but nothing to note otherwise .
she was told that they only have one cart !
this is a pretty big hotel , so that is ridiculous .
we simply ordered _num_ bagels , coffee and tea for breakfast .
oh yeah , the ac sounds like a _num_ taking off above your bed .
i 'm sure you can find better accommodations in this price range and location .
there is nothing to eat within walking distance .
not delivering .
i do n't need to spend my money there .
could n't do that !
im never going back .
delivery was good for a salad but for everything else i was sadly disappointed .
no this was just gross .
my noodles were cold ... like really cold .
i will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible .
service was terrible !
i am disappointed the table i was most concerned about is horrible .
avoid at all costs !
upon receipt she told the manager she could n't see clearly .
the doctor confirmed her prescription was accurate and the glasses were off .
do not shop here , it 's not worth the risk .
they are so rude do n't waste your time here .
i made a change in frames less than _num_ hours from original order .
was told there would be no problem .
mine were n't made because they had the wrong size lens .
this store is terrible .
took _num_ days to pick up the cut sofa !
they were then _num_ hours late picking it up !
terrible .
assistant manager says he had no way to contact delivery people for assistance .
please save your money and visit another store or company .
terrible .
it took _num_ 1/2 months for my office furniture to arrive .
in the mean time my sales rep was fired apparently .
this is not what you promised to sell me .
gag !
the clerk said she was sorry .
garden ridge is not the same ... it has really gone downhill .
their shopping carts are all rusty and broken .
i miss the old garden ridge .
is it me or have the prices at garden ridge gotten ridiculously high ?
no wonder the store was empty .
i called garden ridge to speak to a customer service rep .
gave me a texas number .
too much trouble .
too many other competent companies to model after .
im _num_ from ohio .
i shop alot , sometimes too much .
not very impressed with my last two trips here .
they ended up calling two more over , but it took way too long .
but you know what words i do n't mind hearing ?
`` unfortunately we do n't have that information . ''
`` apologies for the mistake .
that 's not our usual practice . ''
i 've visited this store _num_ times .
only _num_ times .
first time nothing unusual happened .
i walked around .
i 'm not asking too much .
shes says , `` they 're not '' .
no sorry or who told you this .
smh ... customer service is clearly not on their priority list .
i guess it does n't have to be .
they know they 're going to get customers in regardless .
i 'll limit my visits until i find that treasure .
although i love the store , this store has horrible customer service .
breakfast was good .
was checking in and they completely lied to me about having a separate room .
i could not believe how filthy this store was .
the employees could have cared less as well .
so disappointed .
most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something .
i went back to the counter to find a different manager .
after going through each bag , i could not find the correct band .
thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch .
i wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area .
they are apparently saying i cant cancel a custom order .
am i still expected to keep waiting ?
these people are very difficult to do business with .
will take my money elsewhere .
if they say yes , the bread is likely to be eaten .
btw , we did n't have an inexpensive lunch .
if not , then go .
i dunno .
horrible .
as another reviewer said it was set up weird .
should try ordering from the menu it might be better .
i was disappointed with the selection of food as well .
my husband let me try a bite of his rueben which was really good .
first off , the beer menu .
ultimately , i was n't very impressed .
i just did n't want to create a scene in front of my guest .
i was expecting something stellar , and i feel rather let down .
this stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles .
it was tasteless , and the fruit center was nothing more than filler .
we ca n't believe it .
we can not , therefore , understand the rave reviews .
to each his own , i guess .
the waitstaff are very unprofessional all standing around and talking loud near your table .
i drove _num_ minutes for overpriced `` german '' food .
i will not be coming back at all .
no thanks .
that is the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard .
it is definitely not _num_ days free with no questioned asked .
slowest deli department in town .
i was unable to justify spending $ _num_ or $ _num_ for their membership .
was also told i get free $ _num_ gift certificate at restaurant.com .
i try calling bj 's and wait over _num_ minutes on hold .
no offer to adjust my membership so i ask for $ _num_ refund .
_num_ weeks and so far no refund has hit my account .
the food was not prepared well .
the baked potato was awful and the service was mediocre .
this has only been my 2nd time at a red lobster ever .
i have had better seafood elsewhere .
we were seated quickly for a friday night and the server was fine .
the seafood was a little undercooked and everything was dripping in butter .
red lobster was not the place to be tonight .
the service was horrible .
it seem to be over before it started .
_num_ minutes later , she finally brought it back for me to sign .
never received a refill on my soda .
terribly ran !
food takes forever and it does n't come out right .
the wait staff is slow and management has no clue .
but rather good could n't complain .
it does n't !
the only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb !
everything else is a joke .
i 'm not big on chain restaurants .
not because the food is bad but because i like to try new places .
i see why this restaurant is rated so poorly .
the clientele , for some reason , really made for a loud dining experience .
our waitress was hit or miss and we waited awhile for the bill .
would not visit again .
worst service i have ever had .
the waitress the first time i went was a little short , not personable .
the second time about 2-3 months later was just awful .
i was there on a weeknight , for over _num_ hours .
i just do n't even know what to say .
it made my whole experience disappointing .
i wo n't go back to this location .
our salad and bread came out with our food which was a little irritating .
he was great but everything else was extremely slow .
i really ca n't imagine what could be making it so slow here .
just got back from dinner which took over _num_ hrs .
i hate to blame the kitchen , but i think it 's the kitchen .
plus my caesar salad had slimy wilted lettuce .
food was mediocre as well .
wo n't be coming back .
boxes and toys were all over the floor in the store .
the store needs a major overhaul and some employees who care .
terrible service .
the message to me is management must be blind & ignorant .
the store would not cash out the remaining balance on the gift cards .
this place sucks big time as far as cleanliness and order .
are they going out of business ?
i made a very simple order online -- very difficult to screw up .
huge disappointment .
the sub was not one bit better than subway .
this was a complete waste of my time and money .
my bill : $ _num_ .
no complaints there .
the to-go process makes me want to bang my head against a wall tho .
um no , its like $ _num_ extra for delivery .
not cool .
my advice is anyone picking up a to-go order is to do the same .
the restaurant was clean and the people working were friendly .
wo n't visit again .
waiting in line took roughly _num_ minutes on a tuesday about _num_ noon .
i asked for an estimated wait time , not how many appointments there are .
bad business practices are very disappointing .
that is not a way to earn anyone 's business !
just gon na stand here and get looked over for a little while longer .
decent furniture but wow was i disappointed by the payment process .
why is n't this practice illegal ?
it 's sad to experience systems that work so obviously against the customer .
he just put it on the bill .
worst customer service ever !
ashley furniture will get my business from now on .
at first they said they are unable to do so .
the quality of the furniture turned out to be very poor .
the store told them that they have problems with that manufacturer all the .
to date the store has done nothing to replace the defective furniture .
the worst customer service ever !
they already had my money , so why be courteous now ?
that 's is bad business !
she was super excited and counting down the days until arrival .
they have completely horrible , rude customer service reps .
tried to call corporate and let 's just say they could care less .
thinking back and forth on it did n't seem right .
i was ok with this and it sounded fair enough .
well i went there on january _num_ to return my mattress .
did not want to buy another mattress online .
most places allow return of items within _num_ days , even if a mattress .
it was awful !
this is by far the absolute worst furniture experience i have encountered .
the sales lady made an annoying appearance every ten minutes .
at this point , my patience are very thin .
i mean really , this is ridiculous .
my god the sun will be coming up soon !
that was unacceptable .
the main waiting area is also empty .
they next wanted to try my hands and i refused .
i will never have another mri done there .
the baby starts coming out : doctors runs in my room .
terrible treatment .
if you have an emergency do not come here .
go here to die !
i went here after a car accident that was not my fault .
and i felt like total crap the whole next day at work .
they gave me my cast and i left at _num_ .
i can not be refunded and the bill will be sent .
self checkout is the only option and is a joke .
employees would much rather carry inappropriate conversations for the work place than assist .
sorry wo n't be back !
if no stars could be given that would be more accurate .
this store , however , is definitely lacking in customer service .
no way , no how .
we left , went to the charlotte store and they were amazing .
i called back at 10am instead .
some rude nasty woman answers the phone !
next time your country ass needs to stay home from work .
the person checking me out was not hospitable .
went here and of course had the worst experience getting my bridesmaid dress .
stick to a boutique if you want real customer service .
she did n't say a word to us .
they had _num_ opportunities to assist us with the process and ignored us .
they could n't find it in the `` on holds area '' wth ?
we felt bad , and stuck around .
bad idea .
there is _num_ minutes left to pick and try on dresses !
lost sale opportunity .
a very frustrating moment indeed .
the other staff were horrible !
another lost sale opportunity .
they lost out big time with me .
i open the bag where my dress was and i was so dissapointed .
my problem is with the alterations department .
they also rushed me during my final fitting .
very rude and unprofessional , do n't go there !
brandy was the worst .
if she 's the best , i would hate to see the worst .
do not get your alterations done at this location !
they charge at least $ _num_ more for bridesmaids alteration of a short dress .
the hem was n't even touched and they charged me $ _num_ .
they lack skills .
$ _num_ ?
this whole department is insane .
glad this is all over .
this store is not customer service friendly .
that should have been my first clue to walk away .
so i asked how to return it and he did n't know .
my real complaint is just how rudely we were treated at both locations .
worst service i 've had in a long time .
it was just me and my mom and i just wanted to browse .
so that was weird .
what a horrible experience !
i also came in many times before and the employees never helped me .
they were just sitting down doing nothing .
i am definitely disappointed .
i would n't even give them one star at this location !
this was the worst service and experience i have ever received !
the ladies at the reception desk are horrible !
i called to order contacts and they were utterly confused .
terrible place and i would not recommend this facility to anyone .
i said to myself , this is unsanitary practices being used here .
i asked for a full refund , i was not spending my money here .
this restaurant is so gross and it 's dirty .
but this location puts the name to shame .
are you kidding me - not even inspected prior to delivery .
poor attention to detail , poor quality .
poor follow up .
the guy was obviously knowledgable about mattresses but he was rude and condescending .
tried to pressure me into buying a bed right then and there .
neither of us were impressed .
so if this was based on food i would give buca a _num_ .
two and a half stars , neither a-ok nor real bad .
the lunch portion was huge , too much in fact .
service was absolutely dismal for no good reason .
it was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch .
it was loud and crowded .
needless to say ... i will never go there again !
every time we have eaten here , we were hungry shortly after .
very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy .
it is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food .
at least with this experience , did not have the best server .
he did not seem to be too enthusiastic with his job .
no hurry to go back there ... ever .
i do n't know if i can ever return to buca .
firstly , i knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived .
she just seemed ... off ... or high .
ok , i did , and i stopped eating .
there is nothing worse than someone else 's hair in your food .
so , i kept quiet against my better judgement .
confused !
i just started laughing , i was sure this entire night was a joke .
holy ... cannoli ... get me out of here !
sorry buca , a previous visit was much better than this one .
so disappointed !
you really seem to care about this restaurant 's reputation .
he said they 're making improvements and that i should try it again .
i was n't as impressed with buca as i wanted to be .
the only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage .
it was just okay as a whole .
for our main dish , we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni .
it just was n't as authentic as i was hoping for .
they had _num_ hostess up front doing nothing and did n't even greet us .
why would you even try to seat us like that ?
reason i book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time .
she gave me an attitude .
terrible customer service and it was my birthday .
disappointment .
will never return to the restaurant .
disgusting !
worst italian food ever !
they should n't even call it italian food .
the bread was even bad .
do n't waste your time and money going here .
i was less than impressed .
the meatballs were greasy and very bland .
the price was extremely high for food that was bland and not impressive .
seriously , how many f words can you not use on a yelp review ?
salad came first then bruschetta ( wtf ) toast and tomatoes and cheese .
came out fast , but entre 's came out _num_ mins later .
it was n't bad , just nothing great .
its like the place tries too hard .
as if the food is not the real star of the show .
my server lost me towards the end .
instead it 's a runny broth at the bottom of the bowl .
once again we leave this place unhappy and dissatisfied .
this food is just crap .
i made sure i asked for extra sauce ( just in case ) .
needless to say i was disappointed again !
terrible !
it was also barely cooked , not crispy at all .
what a disappointment !
the fist time after a _num_ minute wait , they brought the wrong food .
they gave us a $ _num_ gift card to make up for it .
avoid !
worst customer service .
staff very rude .
never had problem at other locations .
will not return at this location !
mama ricotta will be a better option .
management very rude and customer service is very poor .
yes , that 's not long , but it 's definitely boring .
i do n't like this place , nor the food .
strange odor - musty old smell .
other table was trying to check out and the bartender and manager ( ? )
very noisy .
but a $ _num_ dinner for _num_ i expect more .
birthday celebration & dessert is n't free ?
service was sub par at best .
last nights visit to buca was less than i expect from this restaurant .
the service was awful .
we were very disappointed .
$ _num_ bill for four -- sorry i expect much better service !
the drinks and salads are also soooo pricey .
nothing special .
the visit i am reviewing was for take-out .
nearly _num_ minutes after that time , my order was still not ready .
it appears this location has a serious management issue .
it more than less ruined our dining experience .
this was a very disappointing dining experience .
we ordered _num_ family portions of _num_ different dishes .
the spaghetti and meatballs were very bland .
the only dish we liked was the chicken dish .
completely ruined our meal .
so this past friday i held a birthday dinner for my mother here .
things quickly got off to a bad start .
the staff would not know i had once asked for that room .
however , i will never return to this place .
ok italian food , portions are big , but you pay for them .
service was ok , birthday dessert was a bowl of whipped cream .
when i walked in and looked over the menu i too was excited .
unfortunately the food did not come close to my expectations .
baked ziti is supposed to have a lot of cheese and sauce .
is n't that what baked ziti is ?
and the veal was dry .
not good customer service .
unless you have no other choice do not shop here .
the store is horribly dirty and the prices are higher then harris teeter .
this place sucks the cashiers are either very rude , slow and incompetent .
unfortunately , the service is some of the worst i 've experienced in charlotte .
they all looked at me , none greeted or walked toward me .
none of the three ever tried to assist .
false advertising on patio furniture .
overall , the look of the store just seems to be tired .
never will be coming back here again .
worst customer service ever !
seriously i waited in the drive thru for like _num_ minutes .
( i was _num_ cars away ) .
i 'm stuck between two and three stars .
after all it is taco bell .
you can usually count on them for cheap and fast food .
the cheap part is always standard .
but , the fast part for this location has struggled for a while .
although , i do really have zero complaints on the food .
after all it is taco bell .
excuse given was understaffed but when you are not busy it does n't fly .
what an ordeal !
despite the cost of the set we had to pay $ _num_ for delivery .
or , they can pick-up the entire set and provide _num_ % credit .
no consideration to the value of our time .
the hostess was very short with me and my date .
no personality and did n't make us feel welcome .
no personality , still .
my date did n't like her steak either .
things have really slipped since then though .
they drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese ... .
my soup was alright - french onion - pretty standard .
we like longhorn , but not this location .
the service here is mediocre at best .
when we eventually got the appetizer the bread , there were no plates around .
_num_ more minutes to get plates .
my caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland .
worst experience in a long time .
our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic .
no such luck .
the only employee i could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender !
from the other reviews it seems i did n't miss anything .
this used to be my favorite steak house in charlotte .
it 's really gone downhill lately .
the last _num_ times i 've eaten here the prime rib was still cold .
he brought it back still cold .
they get two for the great service but everything else was not so good .
her corn on the cob was undercooked .
we will not be coming back again .
probably why ... carlos the manager is cheap and not customer friendly !
our server jeff was the worst waitstaff i 've encountered in many years .
that he did n't know there was a problem ?
that he had been there _num_ months and never had a complaint ?
i wish i would have taken a picture .
i could n't believe they tried to pass that off as a steak .
it 's not a very good longhorn .
my hubby ordered coffee , cobb salad and filet .
no complaints .
his salad had no issues so all in all it was what we expected .
our expectations were not too high and the restaurant delivered just that .
it 's not .
i would not recommend going to this best buy location .
then customer service wouldnt help me .
after waiting another five to ten minutes someone finally came .
no thank you or thanks for you patience .
he put the tv in my truck turned around and walked away .
absolutely horrible customer service !
the worst best buy i have ever visited .
back and forth a total waste of time .
then the manager told me we would not have sold one in the condition .
but they sure sold it to me .
horrible service .
horrible customer service .
only _num_ people in line when arrived .
_num_ minutes later _num_ people still in line .
ridiculous !
horrible is the word .
horrible business practice here .
do not shop at best buy .
they 'll gladly take your money , however , good luck getting issues resolved .
there was a long line and only one employee at the checkout .
they have no clue what the word `` toasted '' means .
the lox bagels are not even made open face .
not going back again .
i got back to my office and the bagel was not toasted .
not the best or the worst mall in charlotte .
they would n't even give us a couple minutes to settle our child down .
i will not be back to see year people again !
gave this mall yet another try again today , disappointed again .
all the regular stores , plus some of the more trashy ones .
which on the mall alone would be _num_ star !
this was the worst customer service i have encountered in awhile .
nothing !
i went to exchange a product , instead i just returned .
i chose the fiesta chicken chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup .
the chicken tortilla soup was just ok .
overall , the experience was horrible .
the service was horrible .
so if you 're coming to drink ... not so bad .
if you 're coming to eat ... ah you might think again !
i was disgusted .
yes i know sometimes things could land i 'm my food .
she then went to get our drinks .
very visible and inappropriate .
i wish i could give a no star review for this location .
the only bright spot was the waitress .
the runny quinoa was a mess and hard to boot .
the pasta at applebee 's are definitely not worth the $ _num_ they charge .
the portions are way too small and not good at all .
we went here with family to have lunch , the service was ok .
that was not to be found here .
the food sucked .
just a mess .
total mess .
please do not use this location .
they do not take responsibility for their mistakes .
it 's a shame , because it was a beautiful gift .
do not do business with these people .
shortly after , another lady comes over .
clearly , i was never meant to know the price of this ring .
the same style etc , just a different ring that fit .
just a bit uncomfortable to see how much someone spent on an engagement ring !
i was very unimpressed with this olive garden location .
secondly , the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company .
anyways , horrible experience .
the table they sat us at , smelled so badly !
i did not even want to put my purse down .
this made my food experience not good .
the place is just older and needs some renovations .
the place is not clean , the table we sat was sticky .
the deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share .
the spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth .
want a zero star option !
i am a fan of olive garden but this one is horrible !
ended up with _num_ meals un eaten .
we got there around _num_ and had no wait for a table .
breadsticks and salad came out like expected .
the breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more .
he ate it and did n't complain ... .
this is probably one of the worst olive garden i have been to .
my server was horrific .
i am completely disappointed .
she and i were both a little nervous about getting poor service .
he said , `` no , absolutely not .
throughout the entire order , we got nothing but attitude .
but the rest of the place , not so much .
could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink ?
otherwise , it would have been pretty good .
i know , i know -- olive garden , how pedestrian of me !
when we sat down , i was immediately hit by a gross smell .
it smelled badly like wet dog .
how disgusting .
the bread sticks were pretty underwhelming -- there was no garlic or flavor really .
they served salad shortly my goodness this place was slow though .
when it came out , it was pretty lousy .
i 'd stay away from this garden like the plague , though .
i feel like the food is not flavorful and are always missing something .
this place was disgusting !
the food was gross , greasy and very bad .
i gave it one star because of the waiter .
smells like wet dog .
service was very bad today .
delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking !
the service however , left much to be desired .
our server was obviously having a bad night .
it took almost _num_ minutes to get our salad .
at that point our drinks were empty .
poor service .
service is very bad .
waitress was throwing plates on the table .
have been to many restaurants but this was my worst experience .
wow , only in charlotte would you find a chain restaurant bar crawl .
it 's og though , so neither were anything spectacular .
it saved me from cooking and doing dishes though .
we wo n't be stopping back to celebrate at this location again .
food came slow and was cold .
but the reason i went was to try the lobster raviolis .
there i was very disappointed .
shrimp on top was nice but no lobster filling .
i just remembered why i do n't visit chain sit down restaurants .
i 'm glad there was more mango than strawberry .
the strawberry was too sweet .
by far the worst service we 've had in a while .
i am a big fan of olive garden but not this one .
a refill was never offered .
the salad was swimming in dressing where normally the dressing is light .
it was totally different from all other og restaurants i 've visited .
i doubt that i 'll ever go back to this location again .
no one was at the door to greet me .
i had to walk around the whole restaurant to find my husband .
what a terrible manager !
i see the server standing right there with no response .
slow service and a mediocre meal .
for example , at my most recent visit i ordered the steak gorgonzola alfredo .
the steak was supposed to be medium ; instead it came well done .
( that might also explain the meat being overdone ) .
very disappointing .
i do n't like chains a lot , but some i tolerate .
it 's noisy , crowded , disorganized , and there are not enough waiters .
so far really slow food service .
okay , but wo n't be going back soon .
saturday was my first time back and i was dissapointed in the changes .
otherwise i would have brought him with me and we could have dined in !
really made me sad .
its not like she got nothing out of it !
the fries were bad .
not crispy but chewy and not very salty .
does n't seem like good customer service .
never again will i deal with these useless morons .
first mistake .
this was a no go for me .
i went and told carmax and they said ford was lying .
_num_ hour later it was completed .
they tried to charge me $ _num_ for _num_ hours of labor .
they then corrected it and charged me a flat fee of $ _num_ .
if this is their generic price for _num_ hour of labor it is ridiculous .
it should n't have take an hour to do it anyway .
the owner called me to apologize .
i probably wo n't be back .
i only stopped because i needed ta repair that day and they were close .
it is my pet peeve .
it is wrong .
i needed a patch so i could go on about my day .
the young man who greeted me seemed a little turned off by my coupon .
i thanked the jerk for his time and drove off .
he tried to `` screw '' me over .
bad move buddy .
are you freaking kidding me ?
i have never dealt with such poor management in my life .
i am brand new to the area and never ordered from this location before .
who knows , maybe i was going to order a pizza anyway !
the pizza was cut all messed up as well .
simply put , horrible experience .
send it my way , i 'll get you payment .
that same day i called another company and booked them with no issues .
i made a reservation on monday to pick up some equipment on saturday .
they confirmed my reservation on the phone .
no big deal .
dew & when they brought it out , it was in a can .
so , obviously , no free refills .
gross .
i stuck them in my mouth and wow ... they were flavorless .
ridiculous .
really sad about this one .
we normally delivery at work 2-3 or _num_ times a week .
the pricing is ridiculous .
this is not ihop quality food .
_num_ % of the time , the eggs are not done anyway .
i was very uncomfortable .
drinks are not made properly and the draft beer was warm .
from everyone , including bartenders , which is strange to say the least .
we 've been there twice and witnessed one fight per night .
dogs also get some time to run in a huge play area outside .
however , be sure to ask for a tour and see the space .
when we called they said no payment , no dogs .
they would not give me the dogs and work out a payment plan .
they said they have no idea where the dogs are now .
very disappointed !
i would not leave my dogs there .
quickly losing stars .
not a fan .
the employees and jewelry itself saved this review from being a _num_ star .
too bad , jared 's .
printed out my receipt .
couple weeks later , no phone call .
she was having a hard time finding my order .
ummm no ?
not coming back anymore after i find another band to replace this band .
poor customer service when trying to use reward from app .
this is a review of their business practices online .
slow , absolutely the worst .
horrible communication skills and customer service .
i visited recently and i will not be returning , ever !
at 1:30 i asked about my vehicle and was told i was next .
at _num_ pm i asked for my car .
there was no apology given or really any concern about customer service .
left this store and went to jiffy lube down the street .
hate the place !
this midas location is grossly overpriced !
beautiful courtyard less than _num_ yards away .
but no way to cancel , need _num_ hours notice for us ... .
there 's a reason no one goes here .
service is horrible .
do n't bother to stop .
you have been warned .
worst arby 's in the planet .
there were only two orders ahead of me , utterly ridiculous .
when we walked in , it was like we were in the south pacific .
the thermostat must have been set at _num_ .
maybe that 's for atmosphere , but it was not enjoyable .
it 's bad .
really bad .
otherwise , it stinks .
let me first tell you that i 'm not really a sushi guy .
but this was nasty .
that 's not too bad , right ?
add that to the place , the staff , the price - go elsewhere .
you 'll have a much nicer experience .
ugh ... do n't waste your time or your money !
skip everything else !
some things cold , when they should be hot .
not clean , either .
_num_ per person not worth it .
went for dinner tonight and was disgusted .
tons of garbage and food under these carts .
then all the food was cold and hard .
no idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way .
avoid this place .
the other food was decent , but as i said before was cold .
did not like it .
not the cleanest establishment .
_num_ dollars for two that i 'll never see again .
do n't think i 'll be back .
stealing from your customers is not a great idea china buffet .
avoid this place like the plague !
twenty mins to close but was told that the kitchen was closed .
not going for it .
dried food stuck on silverware , glasses , and plates .
the food on the buffet was cold and tasted old .
the odd food selections are maybe a cross between southern style and fake chinese .
was n't impressed .
because there regular food is mall grade at best .
i do not eat sushi , however my husband does .
they need to be cleaning this dirty restaurant .
it 's definitely not the worst i 've ever had .
very poor .
just not worth it .
poor job .
pleasant staff , but poor quality work .
they damaged my car .
absolutely horrible customer service and product being sold to the public .
highly recommend you find another car wash .
poor customer service !
i wish i had read their reviews prior to going .
the only interior cleaning was vacuum .
they sprayed the windows but obviously allowed them to air dry .
i have paid $ _num_ for a car was and received a better quality .
it 's clear auto only cares about quantity not quality .
i would not recommend this company to anyone ever .
i past here daily and will never patronize this establishment again .
i 've taken my car here at least twice .
both times it failed on a defective license bulb .
well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations .
my guess is they were understaffed .
once we did get seated , service was slow and really bad .
not our best ihop experience .
unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that i ordered for dinner were foul .
without them i 'd have gone hungry that night .
i ordered the country sausage potatoes , pumpkin pancakes & grits .
cold grits are n't a treat .
it was n't the best meal as far as service was concerned .
apparently my empty glass was n't enough of a visual cue .
i 'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the french onion pot roast .
the soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt .
the pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever .
their orange juice is never too tart , never too sweet .
the mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning .
the omelet was uninspired .
it had no flavor whatsoever .
the red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them .
then the stack was topped with whipped cream .
god took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten .
terrible service and terrible food !
food was bland and tasteless and she never bothered to fill our drinks .
never coming back again , it was such a waste of money !
slow kitchen right .
in summary the service is very questionable .
i could n't agree more .
the place smells of old towels and the bathrooms are horrible .
over-priced , slow , very dirty , and an overall sketchy vibe .
not really .
was n't impressed .
the only thing they did n't want to do was flush my brake fluid .
guess it was ok ?
otherwise it was _num_ miles .
i did n't understand why he was asking that or the reason .
he could n't explain why he was asking the question either .
that was a little awkward though .
they are not very through .
he said , `` just grab your registration and come on in . ''
it stayed there for about _num_ minutes before i was called to the counter .
i lost out because the requested work was n't done .
no frills .
no fuss .
typical fast chinese food .
their prices are cheap , and our food was just ok .
i mean , there was oil dripping out of the inside .
almost as if it had been taking a bath in grease .
could have been a fluke , but i am guessing msg ?
, but a couple places in charlotte made me like it again .
this is not one of them .
would n't recommend .
giving _num_ stars instead of _num_ just cause i 've had worse .
boneless ribs were n't typical .
not rib meat .
very dry .
but bags were covered in grease .
i had to wash my hands just from opening the bag .
rice was over cooked .
complete mush .
there is no lobby .
this rink just did n't blow my mind .
i also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink .
they serve beer and wine !
really need to put some money into this place .
entire place smells like wet dog .
they have an assortment of beer and wine .
when that was fixed , the lines did n't roll over properly .
two different people in my office were reduced to tears .
the said they would get back to me within _num_ hours .
there are many places less expensive or where you get more for your money .
i ask again , are they hot ?
she did n't massage anything .
i have n't felt this ripped off in a very long time .
i fianc gave me a gift card here for my birthday .
he did the total opposite .
for $ _num_ i expected so expected something a lot better .
needless to say i am extremely displeased with my services here .
the only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout .
she clearly saw us walk up , and my mother go into the shop .
i continued to stand there , and finally she ( lindsey ) greeted me .
over crowded , loud , and not a relaxing experience .
stayed at the hotel and booked two massages .
sadly not worth the money or time .
i was planning to go again but not anymore .
services between spas are typically the same .
the locker room was ridiculously crowded ( too small ) .
this resort is most definitely not worth the ladies weekend .
it was over $ _num_ thrown in the trash .
i 've been a yelp user for years .
i come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left .
why take down my room number if you were n't going to call me ?
waited for the shuttle around _num_ min at the airport .
i got rid of it myself , though lol .
i would give this place a _num_ star if i could !
this is not the courtyard i was expecting .
common areas needed to be vacuumed !
but their repeated attempts to enter woke us up .
then staff tried to get in !
coffee pot in our room was broken .
_num_ stars might be too generous !
this place is awful .
the internet is so slow it is not functional for basic email .
this trip has no internet .
this place is disgusting .
my room was not clean .
the air did not function properly .
very disappointed .
they were gracious to direct us to signs that got us out of parking .
this place charges $ _num_ for _num_ minutes .
there was no attendant at the booth when we left .
luckily , we had two $ _num_ dollar bills and it worked .
bank of america credit cards are sticky with fees that you do n't deserve .
lo and behold , twenty minutes later , they called us back over .
it was clear servicing customers was an inconvenience to him .
customer friendly said there is nothing he can do .
when i complained how they failed to honor my reservation mr .
at this office any reservation you have is basically worthless .
nor has the manager ever returned my message .
i had two dogs , fries , and a coke for lunch .
frankly ( haha ) , it did n't do anything for me .
maybe the hot dog is cold , but the chili is hot .
i want to like this place , but just ca n't .
the chilli they use is worse than that mystery meat texas pete canned chilli .
if i could give less than one star , i would .
let 's start with having a _num_ sanitation rating .
ie skinny burgers with simple ingredients ( ie american cheese and ketchup ) .
it was quite mediocre for old school burgers and fries .
the chili was not very good either and the fries were pretty tasteless .
maybe i just ordered the wrong thing on the wrong day .
did n't see too much in particular that i loved about this place .
and once again , pretty nasty .
no thanks .
three strikes jackson 's , you wo n't see me again .
walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel .
the bathroom was awful , bedding lumpy and ancient , and the lighting poor .
will not be staying here again .
the place was so slow .
$ _num_ and we both left and ate pizza .
this was not a four star dining experience .
really disappointing .
no one wanted to complain as it was a customer event .
but i would have sent it back if i were on my own .
four star _num_ diamond yea right .
no creativity to the cooking .
at times we could barely hear ourselves think , let alone hear each other .
the steak was overcooked .
the cheesecake looked and tasted like it was a store bought frozen dessert .
turns out , that wine was not included and was a $ _num_ bottle .
most of our bill was the wine .
could have being very good but it was not .
i find it acceptable , but nothing special .
in fact , the menu is , to me , kinda boring .
the waitress was n't rude , but she just was n't there .
i guess for $ _num_ i could n't complain .
bad food .
bug problem .
also my veggies were n't seasoned at all and were not even steamed .
nothing special on this menu ... .
the food , on the other hand , is not good .
spicy crab soup did not have crab meant in it .
it was n't even spicy .
no , the waiter was quick to tell me i ordered medium rare .
by now , my companions had finished eating .
the meat was so tough , i gave up after a few pieces .
nothing to write home about .
do n't understand the hype .
not a good dinner place .
this showmars used to be awesome .
i would have given it _num_ stars .
this showmars is under new management and it sucks !
also , the portions are not as big .
change management and has gone down hill .
it 's slow , portions are smaller and the staff is terrible .
missed opportunity .
gone was the flavor and little taste of spicy burn at the end .
major disappointment !
i asked wth and they told me , management change .
that makes me so sad knowing i will never experience that wonderful flavor again .
good food , but poor service at this particular location .
a shame .
i 'll continue to frequent other locations , just not this particular one .
i 'm sorry but what is the big deal ?
and everything is ala carte !
no way .
i was not impressed by anything here .
but quality steaks can be eaten at much better priced establishments .
he apologized and asked me to come back as he was gone .
the bartender never came back to me to take my drink order .
as diners we would like prompt service and attention but this was not good .
highly disappointed !
the last two times i have been there were not good .
it appears that the oven was too hot .
my steak was not cooked to the right temperature - well vs medium well .
poor service and the food was overpriced for the quality .
nothing tasted bad but it was way too expensive .
i would recommend capital grille over morton 's .
an hour .
_num_ ) write down orders so you do n't forget .
we do n't care !
i wish i could leave a no star rating .
service was awful .
the bartenders had no desire to serve `` us '' .
worst steakhouse experience i have had to date !
we may have waited _num_ minutes before our table was ready .
at this point we still had not seen our server .
i poured my own wine refills .
we ate our dinner quickly because of how hungry we were .
very little apology from the staff about the horrible experience .
even at the discounted price we paid for queens feast we felt robbed .
_num_ of _num_ of our steaks came out totally wrong .
chili 's can cook a better steak than them .
ridiculous .
this last experience was by far the most disappointing .
_num_ sides came out late .
i ordered the bone in fillet , they brought me a ribeye .
so i had to eat my sides cold .
the flavor is ok but why is the dog so skinny ?
they made it anyway and gave it to me .
there is no excuse .
they did not have many items .
do they not make fresh brew coffee .
maybe this starbucks just want to sell all the coffee they made this morning .
starbucks is not the right one for me .
not like you starbucks !
cool sports bar , pool tables and ample flat screens .
but this was pretty bad .
ok , mistake .
it just is n't up my alley though .
also the bathrooms where in bad shape .
i really hate this place .
i 've given it _num_ chances , and they all sucked .
food was awful .
staff was overwhelmed , they tried , but to no avail .
this is the first , and probably only , negative review i have posted .
simply a bad experience .
the food took way too long as well and was only lukewarm .
i refuse to ever set foot in this sub-par establishment again .
pretty obvious the waitress did n't know the table numbers .
at the same time she got sat another table of _num_ women .
the beer specials and _num_ .
seems he was already looking to replace the manager .
we walked in and it was awkward .
no waitress no one else walking around .
we counted _num_ parties , thats it ... in a otherwise bare restaurant .
our drinks were refilled often without being asked .
will not be back .
we just received the worst service ever i will never come back .
service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly .
it was awful we could n't find any positive in it .
it was _num_ of us and _num_ ppl got their checks .
to further add to the drama , the parking garage has virtually no signage !
a shame , really , for my once favorite bar in charlotte .
went in to meet some friends who 'd come in from out of town .
the music was too loud for conversation .
summary : very noisy , terrible service .
wild dogs could n't drag me back .
i stood there for approx 5-7 mins before i was even acknowledged .
my braised short ribs were all bones !
i sent their management a message , but have not yet heard back .
been here twice ; both times it was an awful experience .
we will not be going back .
apparently , reservations are not valued here .
he needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made .
did n't get our food until after _num_ .
food is n't good either .
greasy and the batter was peeling off .
i did n't get what i ordered .
i over cooked greasy fries like everyone else .
it had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it .
stopped in after the theater for a pint , but could not get served .
so , we again waited & never did see a server .
there was absolutely no seasoning on them and they had zero taste .
even adding salt and pepper did not help it .
i called the manager over , to let them know the situation .
easily takes _num_ min to get a drink .
for $ _num_ i 'd expect a lot more .
the rose sauce was n't as flavorful as i would expect .
that is a lot for a less than adequate sandwhich .
i will not be coming back .
just average unfortunately .
the mediocre : everything else .
the really really low point of the meal was the desert .
the bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock .
and questioned why it was cold .
bread pudding is always warm no ?
lobster and potato cakes could have been better - too salty imo .
even the door man commented on how rude the bartenders were .
never going back .
the menu is n't extensive , so keep in mind your options are limited .
and , all were nothing to write home about .
not worth it .
know your customers , bring back the stew .
hostess was extremely unprofessional and rude !
no one was uptown and the place was completely empty .
worst lunch option uptown .
i will not be returning .
my lunch companion had roast beef and regretted ordering anything .
server was very slow and was n't attentive .
bouncer was extremely rude .
we had a reservation for _num_ for a casual business dinner .
it took _num_ minutes to get our server to take our dinner order .
it was very difficult to get our server 's attention throughout the evening .
the food came quick but no potato soup .
the service itself was n't to great either .
the wait staff was not that great either !
the bartenders attitude were like `` we r annoyed cause we r there '' .
we walked in and waited to be sat .
no one came or even looked at us .
the bartender looked at us walked away .
after _num_ minutes he never returned .
when i come back to charlotte i wo n't be trying this restaurant again .
i had carryout .
very quick but kinda confusing to find the place .
so far i have not found a good chinese food place here in charlotte .
i would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland .
still looking for a good chinese food place here in charlotte wish me luck !
sad to say , my entree was a little bland .
it was a tofu , vegetables , and wide rice noodles entree .
food is decent , but service is no good .
unfortunately , went in for lunch today and had a similar experience with service .
will be busy during peak lunch hours from 11:30 to 1:30 pm .
they are rude .
literally rude .
half the time you do n't understand what they speak in english .
no in this restaurant are polite .
unfortunately , the food was sub-par .
i ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp .
i got the steamed chicken dumplings and a order of edamame to go .
the worst part were the soy beans .
when i got the food it was cold and i was so disappointed .
otherwise , i do n't think i 'll order from there again .
if so , then you 'll want to take a pass on this place .
the food by best is subpar and barely mediocre .
the lady at the front desk is absolutely rude rude rude rude .
disgusting phone etiquette and completely appalling .
so sad .
used to be so much better .
no flavor .
everything we ordered was very very bland .
very disappointed in my charlotte chinese .
wo n't be back .
i ca n't imagine how this place has _num_ stars .
fried dumplings were thick and mushy .
the ramen soup was bland .
egg roll was sour of all things .
hot and sour soup also bland .
very bland .
very very bland .
not much pineapple in the chicken pineapple dish .
nor is there any hint of a true thai taste .
i also ordered the curry chicken noodle bowl .
again , very bland .
not much of a coconut taste either .
the _num_ starts are just because the broccoli looks fresh .
not sure if i 'll try again .
instead , it was dry and tasteless i know filling .
waste of a cheat meal .
worst chinese food i 've had in a while .
have you ever been to a sports bar where there is no games on ?
this seemed quite bizarre .
also , why have _num_ screens when you can have one huge one ?
why give french fries with most of them burned ?
food is terrible .
everybody has bad days , they should not be this bad ... .
the chicken wings tasted like fake butter and rubber .
it 's my fault , i guess .
the kids menu was quite pathetic and expensive !
$ _num_ for two small hamburgers ?
i had the thai beef salad and it had about _num_ strips of beef .
flavor was ok but the lack of real substance was overbearing to anything else .
aside from just being terrible , she was also unfriendly .
as a vegetarian , it was entirely another matter for me .
what was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip .
i only gave them _num_ star because _num_ was n't an option .
horrible experience .
the bread was cold and hard .
we had to go , it was getting way too late .
went here a night during final four ( basket ball ) .
the bar was not to noisy and the server was very attentive .
tried their philly cheese steak .
sorry guys you really need to repair the beer machine and hire a cook .
as for a place to spend money uptown i 'd skip it .
the bar is ok , the food is ok , it 's nothing special .
i will never go back to this place , to many other options uptown .
when my food came out , the chicken was cold .
the only thing i liked was their ranch sauce .
it was kind of uncomfortable .
no management present that we could see .
so , why only _num_ stars you ask ?
it 's horrible .
i would n't be as concerned if i were here for pleasure .
so , you get where this is going , right ?
walking into the hotel , it smelled stale .
room three does n't smell much better .
again , stale and moldy .
i like the quiche every morning rotating variety everyday .
but my room is outdated and smells like there has been a massive leak .
not a good sign .
this place is not worth the price !
only _num_ stars for location .
worst hotel i have yet to stay in as a consultant .
wow , i was wrong .
we decided to try room service ... what a mistake .
i talked to the duty manager and he was no help at all .
i found all of this very unacceptable .
it reflects poorly on the entire hotel .
two of my colleagues also have lost stuff in this hotel .
but i strongly believe that the staff in their housekeeping department are not honest .
the room i stayed in was old and run down .
the biggest problem i had though was the paper thin walls .
water pressure in the shower was also horrible .
my biggest complaint though is the housekeeping staff .
loud , loud , loud !
this was my second time staying at this hotel with the same problem .
the `` new '' rooms are terrible .
for a downtown attempt at luxury this is bad .
terrible for business travel .
no desk , no real work surface but an oversized tv tray .
no desk type chair .
which the bench under the tv is an absolutely terrible idea !
just a poor design all around .
rooms are poorly designed .
faux wood floor makes everything echo .
in fact faux wood furniture all around .
while they are remodeling this is no longer a business class hotel .
why in _num_ are hotels still doing this ?
the room are _num_ stars .
when we got back to our hotel .
_num_ caesar salad with flank steak and another caesar salad with shrimps !
both salad looked like they been sitting out for awhile .
stomach hurts all night .
oh well , their loss .
i was seated and served a complimentary salad .
i expressed my disappointment and said please do what you need to do .
terrible customer service !
menu says `` soup '' , no particular type .
waitress said i could double rice , but no soup change .
the place was empty when we got there and when we left .
... no wonder .
one star because zero was n't an option .
oh and the sushi was not fresh and tasted gross .
nigiri sushi was not good at all and neither were the rolls .
they just said thank you and walked away .
we ordered hibachi steak chicken and shrimp with fried rice and vegetables .
was not impressed at all .
did not taste like hibachi at all .
sushi might be good , but i do n't eat sushi .
i just had such a bad experience here .
the employees were extremely rude , the food is overpriced and mediocre .
do n't even get me started .
but the service is horrible .
if i was n't vegan , i 'd eat the dish .
i got uncomfortable with the waitress so i told another waitress about my situation .
do n't think i 'll be coming back .
i used their online service to pick up my laundry .
for three days no one called or picked up the clothes .
i would certainly not recommend this dry cleaners to anyone .
an expensive hassle for such terrible service .
what a mistake it was .
but they are n't reliable .
he truly comes across as if he could care less , and it shows .
breaking off buttons then charging to put back on .
they do n't care about your clothes .
pay more elsewhere for better quality .
i ordered the seabass and it really was n't anything spectacular .
i visited charlotte and decided to go here , cause it was crowded .
there was nothing really special about the food .
i 'd have to say it was no where near an awesome experience .
needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks .
could n't you have just lied to me and told me you were out ?
dont get me wrong , i kinda like applebees .
just dont expect anything amazing .
that might make it a little better .
their menu is way overpriced , with nothing really great on it .
the beer was decent , it 's just draft beer here .
but i do n't think i 'll be going back anytime soon .
ate here on a saturday night for a friend 's birthday .
our server , from beginning to end , was slow .
would have rather spent $ _num_ elsewhere .
also they were not that tender .
my wife had the chicken pesto pasta .
while that was decent , it was n't exciting either .
i mean , we went here thinking we would get a good value .
unfortunately , it 's more than a lot of other comparable places in uptown .
too many other choices in charlotte to come back here .
i have mixed feelings about rock bottom .
unfortunately that burger was `` _num_ 'd '' ... as was her second choice .
i will not be going back .
the food was bad , yo .
like , below applebee 's bad .
i also ordered the southwestern turkey burger .
i was n't impressed with this place .
the beer is awesome i will admit and the servers are pretty attentive .
i ate a little bit , but i did n't want to finish it .
way too much pepper or spices , and i could hardly taste the cheese .
we walked out and still nobody noticed .
this used to be my favorite place uptown .
really disappointed .
really , are they kidding serving store bought salsa ?
the chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn !
not sure we would return anytime soon .
bad service and mediocre food served cold .
the kicker is that this was n't the first time this has happened .
if i could give negative star rating i would .
it was not especially crowded ( no wait ) and we had reservations .
chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers .
more pear shaped , waitress was no where to be found for _num_ minutes .
the rating is not for the appetizer , like i said things happen .
i took my young son with me so it was just dinner no alcohol .
we did n't see him again until after our food was brought to us .
the beer was pretty good , but the food was a real disappointment .
i had the pizza and it was mediocre at best .
the wings were fine , but nothing special .
the restaurant was busy , but was n't packed .
overall they get a d for food and an a for ambience and location .
then no , i have not gotten my beer .
she again left for another _num_ minutes .
was someone else supposed to bring it , did she forget ?
the chicken was supposed to be grilled .
fries with burger were luke warm .
as late as it was , there was no offer to comp the pizza .
but obviously we have no plans to go back .
ick !
half the time our drinks were empty .
so what was the point in an app ?
there were tiny pieces of what looked like artificial crab .
no lobster .
caesar salad should not be too spicy to eat .
i 'd give it zero stars but yelp wo n't let me .
i have eaten here several times & always find it disappointing .
tried a variety of foods & none have been particularly good .
there are no free meals in america andrea !
i would n't even give this place a star for this reason !
we had the worst experience at this place !
it ruined our first visit in charlotte .
their service was horrible and i would never go to any rock bottom !
establishment was not busy at all , decided to seat ourselves at the bar .
this place just does not seem serious about business standards and drinks were weak .
fianc ordered bison burger and ended up getting a 2am with egg , etc .
apparently it 's supposed to be `` loaded '' with roasted chicken .
bun was also cold like just out of the refrigerator .
unacceptable .
i thought it was odd how many empty tables were in the bar area .
i 'd give only _num_ star , but previous visits were acceptable .
not edible .
came in for a quick bite to eat on a sunday for lunch .
the chicken was flavorless and tough .
the fries were cold and mushy .
will not come back here .
the service was very slow and obviously not very interested in being there .
the food was also disappointing .
the chicken breast was so small .
worse was that there was no flavor .
it was just all around bland .
would recommend not sitting outside or at the bar if you want food .
stopped in before the panthers sunday night game .
gross .
bartenders were terrible and not attentive .
waited _num_ minutes before someone asked if we needed something .
unacceptable .
do the bartenders here not work on tips ?
only plus is the beer was $ _num_ and they validate parking .
nobody tried to even convince us to stay .
2nd time service was extremely slow .
nothing that really stands out .
the beginning check in should 've been a red flag for us to run .
_num_ minutes later we were sat .
some drinks were returned from the bar while some never reached the table .
neither of us touched our food .
another couple ordered the cajun pasta and brewery beef tips .
no checks .
we paid for drinks and left our sever a gracious tip .
finally i flagged down a waiter and asked to see the manager .
well , the customer service did n't get much better .
i said it was ok and that i would rather have a mixed drink .
i was starving so at this point i just made do .
when it came down to orders and service though , sadly was disappointed .
the veggies were overly salty table round .
and meats were not cooked to request and the servers forgot the eating utensils .
after _num_ more min .
i was n't particularly hungry and ordered the mexican street tacos .
the broccoli was terrible .
the beer was good , service was ok , but the food was terrible .
i ordered lobster & shrimp `` enchiladas '' , which had practically no filling .
in short , our experience here was awful .
the burgers were just okay .
not particularly flavorful but edible .
the sticks were not actually pretzels .
the did n't look or taste like pretzels , rather like breadsticks .
the cheesy jalapeno dip it was served with was good .
the chicken tacos were good .
i personally ordered the lobster and shrimp tacos and they were served cold .
they were served with a side of bland , instant rice and black beans .
the biggest negative about rock bottom is by far the service .
the service was awful .
it then took quite awhile for our dinners to start arriving .
and then _num_ minutes later , a fifth entree was brought out .
it was not a gluten free menu at all !
very disappointed with this restaurant .
this place was horrible !
do n't get married here .
that was $ _num_ down the drain .
this place is beautiful but not worth the money , stress , or headache .
fish was not fresh .
the manager claims he is very helpful ?
he is not !
this fast food place almost always gets my order wrong .
they charge me for things that they do n't have .
besides the staff being extremely unprofessional , the wait time is always long .
the cashier was very polite , inviting , and helpful .
seems like they used imitation cheese , because it certainly didnt melt .
do n't waste your time ... .
this is not a really cool hang out .
the bar is really small and the staff was really unfriendly .
the place just seemed small and shabby to me .
the restaurant was pretty empty , no wait for a table .
we started off with two appetizers : calamari and crab dip .
we just ignored this and ate the calamari , as is .
the crab dip was another disappointment .
the cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor .
wow , this was just embarrassing ( for them ) .
i had about _num_ bites and just put it aside .
the food was decent but _num_ issues , _num_ major one .
first - the water at this establishment is disgusting .
it was very , very bad .
very bad .
so very bad that i 'm writing my first yelp review .
i will tell people not to go there and i will never go back .
[ the bad . ]
the temperature in the restaurant was hot .
_num_ outside , _num_ inside .
which is just weird in a restaurant setting .
he said , `` we only have _num_ .
we usually have _num_ but we ran out of _num_ today . ''
my order was wrong .
i sucked it up and ate the stupid beef .
the beef was very pink in the middle and was of extremely poor quality .
[ the not so bad . ]
like i said maybe just an off night but we wo n't be back .
so , let 's make that a _num_ stars .
restaurant dot com you 've let me down once again .
i 've got to ask myself why do i keep doing this .
no excuse for an overcooked steak ever , and all ordered medium rare .
avoid this place even if free .
very poor service .
the chicken tasted suspect and the rice was mushy .
seafood noodle soup had slices of pork .
the cilantro garnish was n't even chopped .
the potatoes were like tater tots .
no ketchup ?
it wasnt horrible , it just wasnt great .
this could be an awesome place to stay .
i was given a sofa bed to sleep on .
i had made the reservation several weeks prior , with guaranteed late arrival .
i get to the room and the electronic key does not work .
his key does not work either .
later they apologize for the error .
the bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time .
a gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen .
they also tend to forget some essential ( i.e .
i absolutely hate this place .
btw , no one ever showed up to fix the air .
this is the first time i feel compelled to write a bad review .
the hotel rooms were dirty and service was terrible .
it was not my pillow .
( but they have still not done this _num_ weeks later ) .
i can only say that this hotel has zero commitment to customer service .
the beds were uncomfortable .
_num_ coke = $ _num_ .
i will never be back .
do not stay here if you have a choice .
to add insult to injury , the only restaurant in the hotel sucks .
no concierge .
the hilton would probably have been better or perhaps any of the other hotels .
do n't waste your time staying here if you are a business traveler .
i stayed three nights at the westin with a group for a conference .
two cups of coffee per room per day , extras can be purchased .
so why the low rating ?
here 's the bad points .
wouldnt you think they would have an attendant check on the bathroom on occasion .
big disappointment ... try the hilton .
but its definitely not worth the money .
the fitness center lacks a fan , so working out gets too hot .
i feel like i should only be spending maybe $ _num_ .
otherwise , i will never stay at this place .
there are much better choices in uptown charlotte !
now the bad ... stains .
there is no other way to describe everything in my room .
they just need a better starting product !
i did not find the venue pleasant .
it was then i noticed small mold spots in the shower .
the ac in the room also did not seem to operate properly .
no way it got near _num_ or i would have been freezing .
got _num_ bites for one night .
he also suggested me to go to er if not getting better .
obviously management is not training well for customer service at this location .
conference rooms were poorly set-up , freezing cold , and loud !
avoid the valet at all costs !
description said grain mustard cole slaw and pickles .
the coleslaw was a couple pieces of lettuce with some carrots .
either the batteries are almost dead or its just terrible .
at _num_ am and two phone calls , still no coffee .
no apologies .
big box , impersonal hotel .
the views are not worth it .
time to check out and never come back .
staff was supposed to help with a reservation and dropped the ball .
the hotel is starting to look warn and needs investment .
total time spent _num_ hour for a $ _num_ drink .
no ... not a sir and i wanted to order mozzarella wheels .
`` oh ok that 'll be $ _num_ . ''
i pretty much hate this hotel .
this hotel is a complete ripoff !
other than that , customer service is awful .
the restaurant is the worst .
and they got my order wrong .
how the heck do you get that order wrong ?
we were disappointed in this hotel .
lobby bar staff was unfriendly .
we stayed for four nights and got minimal cleaning service in our room .
the phone call from the manager @ 7:00 am ruined the trip for me .
i did n't appreciate it , understand it , or like it at all .
this is the worst westin i 've ever stayed in .
i even asked my husband to check in case i missed it .
i waited about _num_ mins and still no menu .
we check in , we get the wrong room .
their televisions could be called outdated ... at best .
they tried to fix the broken telephone but were n't really successful .
i stayed here for a week .
i dunno .
both experiences have been terrible .
it was fixed promptly , but made a bad first impression .
quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life .
noisy , dirty , poorly renovated and the worst customer service known to man .
does n't even deserve one star in my book .
avoid at all costs !
the rooms were clean but i would not stay here again .
it 's awful and we wo n't be going back .
the worst of our experience ?
if anyone 's had theft problems , this may be why .
there are many choices in charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one .
under renovations until december _num_ , _num_ .
the staff was friendly every time we walked past the front desk .
the restaurant across the street was apparently a night club as well .
we tried to nap but simply could n't .
more screaming and yelling than the night before .
it literally sounds like there is a major concert going on .
the staff called the cops who are apparently there but not doing anything .
i stayed at this motel for _num_ nights ( june 19th & 20th ) .
i called & talked to manger as soon as i saw the bites .
when we checked out i spoke to manager & showed her my bites .
i 'm still waiting to find out what ate me up !
no way would i ever stay at this motel again .
beware veterans , they do not acknowledge war .
no more .
veterans beware !
do not stay st this hotel .
do n't expect too much .
the room doors are all spring loaded to they slam shut .
not a quiet hotel at anytime of the day .
we went on a friday and it was n't too busy .
and they did n't seem too concerned about my complaint .
and the bathrooms were nasty .
bottom line is poor excuses for terrible work .
sorry for the comment .
i signed up as they knocked at my door .
i was a customer for approx _num_ yrs .
only because they were my only option .
time warner cable is awful .
also , they really have the worst customer service i have ever dealt with .
its also extremely odd that they could not contact me via e-mail or telephone ?
would that have been so difficult ?
well money talks so they talked me into giving them another try .
horrible !
worst service ever !
i get it .
however , the sucker that i am for a deal , i got it .
shame on you , time warner cable .
some of the worst service ever .
i then recieved the bill the next month and the price had no change .
ok , no big deal .
she talked to the computer screen instead of to my face .
talk about unpleasant .
terrible customer service .
called back and was told wait time would be _num_ minutes .
i read somewhere that charlotte has the highest time warner rates in the country .
avoid this company if you can .
once they have you they make it hard to escape .
do n't even get me started with their customer service , or lack of .
when i finally get someone on the phone , they are rarely helpful .
possible the most frustrating company i have ever interacted with .
since they apparently hire good people , hire more !
the folks on the phone are incredibly rude .
absolute _num_ % avoid at all costs .
there is no email and i have spent hours on the phone .
i do not like this company !
inconsistent billing , poor customer service , and lies sum up this service .
ca n't wait for more service providers .
are you kidding me time warner ?
let 's add up those dollars , shall we , time warner ?
i also wish that i could provide them with zero stars .
this company is the worst to deal with .
after about _num_ minutes she realized she was entering it incorrectly .
therefore they installer never made it to my apartment .
but i placed the order online , then i am on hold again .
i 'm done i throw in the towel trying to deal with them .
why did n't i go with them first ?
should n't be too hard of a task , yeah ?
wrong .
how can i help you today ? ''
( _num_ minutes of this ) .
`` ok , sir .
( _num_ minutes on hold ) ... ... ... ... ... ... still transferred .
`` hello , sir .
the story does n't end there .
bad idea .
horrible service !
i vote time warner cable the worst company of all times .
do n't get me wrong there are other bad and good companies .
after that i would say sprint is the 5th worst .
so , i get online again , and guess what ?
worst customer service of any business i 've ever dealt with .
i am not holding my breath here .
i wish there were zero stars .
horrible , horrible company .
took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done .
worst service ever !
the drop off process for returning your cable box is ridiculous .
worse customer service ever .
before i talked to them , i could change channels and had a picture .
the worst place on earth .
what a joke of a company .
i did not have internet for about a month .
so one month _num_ tech support calls later i got this information .
time warner cable is the worst !
stay away from them like the plague if possible .
the first winter storm and the cable and internet is out .
no way to find out what is going on .
stay away from time warner .
time warner cable has the absolute worst customer service i have ever come across .
if i could leave a lower rating , i would .
absolute thieves and liars .
i feel like i 'm in line for a bad carnival ride !
this is absolutely the worst place i 've ever been to .
do you ever leave a place and feel exhausted ?
this is the worst line i have ever seen in my life .
well they delayed the change for _num_ weeks so they could collect more longer .
the whole call took _num_ minutes most of it on hold .
poor customer service .
i would gladly give less than one star , alas , not possible !
not to mention the constant slow internet .
you 'll never get out unless you die .
terrible customer service .
ca n't wait to cancel service .
just know that they have horrible customer service and technicians .
no one ever knows what they are talking about and problems are never resolved .
if you can help it , do n't get cable from this cable company .
worst customer service and business model i have ever seen .
literally , anywhere .
we 've been going through the same problems for years now .
to any new potential new customer out there , please be warned .
just do n't do it !
i have never been so disappointed with a company .
i have to wait _num_ days to have service restored .
i can not recommend this company .
first , let me say i wish you could leave _num_ stars .
its crime and misleading to even give time warner _num_ star !
i do n't even see how time warner is even in business !
the sad part is that its not even the technicians fault .
_num_ up ?
another appointment was setup , and yet again no call and no show .
worst company ever .
ca n't wait till google comes to save us .
worst run business in the free world .
wanting faster internet i signed up .
they are out dated and their customer `` service '' is non existent .
they do n't care about anyone .
the worst everything .
worst ever at everything they do .
if i could give negative stars i would .
eventually they brought me something but they were just sooo rude .
will never go back to that place again .
the person that seated us was curt and unfriendly .
the dishes that night were sub-par , which was a first .
i honestly have no clue !
only good thing about this place was my company .
finally this place was stale like the bread !
could n't have happened to a more deserving group of people .
found out he left less than a month after this incident .
plus , cold rude staff .
my trim & partial high lights took _num_ 1/2 hours though !
so i would say , sure - check them out .
just be sure to make your appointment with someone with experience .
$ _num_ pedicure should have been way better than it was .
skip it and try somewhere else for a spa pedicure .
safe to say , i was really upset and disappointed when i left .
first , they charge for beer and wine .
this results in my paying $ _num_ i should n't have had to pay .
too big , almost .
so many fountains , open areas , gardens to visit .
look , stop being cheap .
lame .
this place is horrible .
they lead me to each exit , and each time they were locked .
not so much at uptown charlotte .
the door not only did n't close , it did n't fit the frame .
but for a few seconds , water completely stops .
terrible front desk staff & way over priced .
the front desk staff was not interested in helping me checkin .
she kept answering the phone even though others were there .
made a one night stay $ _num_ .
i can send it to marriott if requested . )
coffee makers were loudly talking , and seemed annoyed at my presence .
wo n't be returning .
worst experience of my life .
tried to buy a book and have it shipped as a christmas present .
my simple question was : do you price match to you own website ?
his immediate reaction was rolling his eyes and said no we do n't !
i do n't want anyone else to go through this .
this review is for alterations only .
not measured correctly - very angry !
gross .
maybe i chose poorly but i was n't impressed at all .
smoked salmon plus creamy sauce , yum .
the underwhelming : the french onion soup was not hot .
maybe , to try the breakfast everyone seems to enjoy so much .
but probably not for dinner .
`` every christmas story ever told '' was slow and not that funny .
the first half dragged .
worse than cans .
is it worth the $ _num_ cover on fridays ?
not really .
i thought it was a bit too much .
this really is n't somewhere i want to be .
i 'm _num_ and i almost felt too old there .
but maybe that says more about me than it does bar charlotte .
for that reason , i ca n't give this place less than two stars .
$ _num_ for anything !
i just came from there .
i grabbed my daughter by the arm and led her out of there .
it is not safe for kids !
they changed it without notice , i 'm a little bitter .
it 's _num_ or _num_ bucks now after _num_ .
it 's not worth it .
i did n't touch anyone .
worst bar ever .
never going back .
i ordered smoked pork chops , home fries and green beans .
it was a total disappointment for me .
i was embarrassed for recommending this restaurant .
the fried chicken was straight forward .
it was a tad weird .
the collards were authentic and would get them again .
overall rating - just an ok .
however the experience here was not very good !
i was unable to comfortably eat for approx .
_num_ to _num_ minutes .
i ordered fried chicken , greens , yams , catfish , and banana pudding .
_num_ ) the fried chicken was n't really fried .
it looked like baked chicken that was dried out .
not crispy looking , not seasoned .
not very tasty .
_num_ ) the catfish was a complete fish with bones .
_num_ ) banana pudding was very good !
_num_ ) red beans rice and sausage was not good .
to many restaurants want my patronage .
however , it all went down hill from there .
finally , we just said thanks , but no thanks and left .
the only fast service was for the drinks and cornbread .
the food was alright and i thought that the portions were a good size .
but i think that the service was absolutely terrible .
i will not eat there again .
i rarely give bad reviews , but this was a pretty horrible food experience .
huge disappointment .
the fried chicken was pretty bland .
it seemed like it was pre-made and left out for too long .
the collard greens were insanely salty .
instant high blood pressure for sale !
: ( i ordered the salmon cakes which were really hard .
fried chicken , macaroni and cheese and collards .
the chicken was tasteless and the mac was bland .
the service was n't great either .
not impressed .
i went a second time just in case they were having a bad day .
the catfish was fried too hard and did not have any meat on it .
the okra and tomatoes were alright .
the service here sucks .
never going to go back again .
horrible !
not really impressed .
however , she did n't bother , probably because we were n't her table .
overall experience could have been better , but at least we tried it .
even the home fries where spicy .
i needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention .
the economy is not doing well.
with that said ... mert 's was disappointing and overpriced .
the mac n cheese and pound cake was ok at best .
the greens and yams were ok .
horrible !
i would not recommend this place and would never go back .
i ca n't believe people like this food .
to tell the truth , the service ran along the lines of pretty poor .
she never refilled our drinks either .
the fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them .
it was hard to find `` tomatoes '' in the dish .
waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved .
surprisingly , none of it was really that good .
service was cheerful though .
my biggest problem was the service .
she was surly and very uninterested in doing her job .
honestly some of the worst service i 've ever received anywhere .
my husband and i are pretty patient people , but this was ridiculous .
fried chicken , chicken tenders , and salmon cakes were also okay .
try a waffle house and i think you 'll have a better dining experience .
servers had awesome personalities and were very hospitable .
however , the food ... .
sucked .
the collards were not cook well and my salmon patties were burnt .
this was not good soul food at all .
i liked the atmosphere but the food was way too salty .
just did n't care for it .
the yams were out of a can so that was a major let down .
seems like a tourist spot to me .
the food left a lot to be desired .
reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough .
really disappointing .
this smell will stick to you for four to five hours at least .
the corn bread was the only good thing in the restaurant .
i ordered chicken wings which was cold and `` rubbery '' .
the service on the other hand was not .
i was confused asked to speak tho the manager by another waitress .
that waitress says sure she 's the lady over there in the red shirt .
so needless to say we will not be returning back to this establishment ever !
the collard greens had an excessive amount of uncooked onions and tomatoes .
my kids would not even eat them .
not so !
all said , we spent $ _num_ for soul food !
this place is not worth the price .
what a disappointment !
but the real let down was my shrimp and grits .
no seasoning .
no flavor .
my husband and i went to mert 's on sunday morning around _num_ .
not one said i will be your server i will be with you shortly .
not one said would you like some water .
not one said let me find who your server is .
this went one for _num_ minutes before we decided to get up and leave !
the service is terrible !
ultimately , there was confusion about who was responsible for our table .
she indicated that a long wait to be acknowledged is not common practice .
she invited me back to the restaurant .
but it was cheap and the corn bread was excellent .
every order was lacking just that little something that would make a meal enjoyable .
the worst customer service by server and manager .
tonight 's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences i 've ever had .
supposedly there was a computer error with our food .
however while waiting two hours , we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner .
consider actually checking on the food .
all the tables around us came , ate and left .
she did not even follow through on that promise .
pathetic .
over _num_ % of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention .
the server never apologized .
nor did he bother to even clear our plates .
finally i had enough and walked out .
horrible customer service !
( not the waitress ) .
she was sarcastic & unprofessional .
the waitress could have cared less that we had to wait .
horrible service !
came back _num_ minutes later with lame lie .
another _num_ minutes later still no food , not even apps .
hostess also provided _num_ new lame lies .
dishonest staff ruined it for me .
chicken was dry , green beans under seasoned and bland .
the macaroni was good , they used cream cheese or something that tasted okay .
they got two orders wrong in our party of _num_ though .
over three hour wait for mediocre food and poor service .
one food runner , female , came to our table with the wrong food .
let 's just say everyone has something bad to say about their entree meal .
service was extremely slow .
it was cold and soggy .
the mac and cheese was good but again , it 's mac and cheese .
would n't go back .
the worst restaurant ever !
the service is the worst !
lazy and slow as ever !
do n't know what that meant ; did they run out of spinach ?
we ended up with two other omelettes , the garden and the shrimp creole .
however , we were highly disappointed by the food .
not the best soul good i 've ever eaten .
the fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about .
mac n cheese can pass for soul food .
corn bread mediocre , overall it was okay .
big fail on that expectation .
we did n't know if her reaction would be positive or negative .
after paying my bill i waited for my change that never came .
the waitresses have bad attitudes and rush you when ordering .
this was by far the worst soul food experience .
second time may be a charm but the first time was a complete failure .
the yams were hard as if they were freshly cut and simply plated .
tiger wood drinks were very tasty .
our server was not at all attentive to our needs .
the initial one that i received had obviously been sitting out too long .
it was cold .
overall , the experience was not very pleasing .
however , this was our experience .
